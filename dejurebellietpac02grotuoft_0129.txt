majestatis imminutae‚ tum in iis quae ad privata commoda per-

modi sint pacta conventa, a quibus discedere lex patiatur,
etiamsi pacta honestati sint consentanea: non enim ideo teneri
quia juraverit, sed quia justis conventionibus quisque teneatur,
quatenus alterius intersit.

dem privatos Nam in regiis actibus quae rex facit eo loco
habenda sunt, quasi communitas faceret: in tales autem actus
sicut leges ab ipsa communitate factae vim nullam haberent,
quia communitas seipsa superior non est, ita nec leges regiae.
Quare adversus hos contractus restitutio locum non habebit:
venit enim illa ex jure civili. Non admittenda igitur exceptio
regum adversus contractus quos minores fecissent.

As to the first head, it is made a question whether the king, as he
can relieve his subjects from an oath, can do the same to himself, and
put himself back into his original condition. Bodinus thinks that the
king may be so reinstated, on the same grounds as a subject would be
so; whether he have been circumvented by the fraud and deception
of another party, or by his own error, or fear 3 and this, both in
matters which affect the rights of the sovereignty, and those which
pertain to private advantage. He adds, that the king is not even
bound by an oath, if the conventions made are of that kind from
which the law permits parties to recede, even though the agreement
is conformable to propriety3 for (he holds) heis not therefore bound,
because he has sworn‚ but because every one is bound by just con-
ventions‚ so far as the interest of another is concerned.

2 We make a distinction here, as we have done in other places,
between the acts of the king which are royal acts, and acts of the same
person which are private acts. For in royal acts, what the king does
is to be held as if it were done by the community: and as laws mado
by the community itself would have no fcrce over such acts, because
the community is not superior to itself, so neither have laws made by
the king any such force. Thereforo against such contracts, restitution
will not hold: for this restitution is a creature of the Civil LaW.
And thus kings are not relieved from contracts which they had mado
as minors.
