ut alius esset liber, alius servus. Quare qui legitima causa
in servitutem sive personalem sive civilem devenerunt, eon-
tenti sua conditione esse debent, ut et Paulus Apostolus docet: 1 Cor· vii· 21-
δοῦλος ἐκλήθης; μή σοι μελέτω· vocatus es ad servitutem?
ne id te torqueat.

XII. Neque minus iniquum armis subigere aliquos velle,
quasi dignos qui serviant, quos naturaliter servos interdum
philosophi vocant. Non enim siquid alicui est utile, id statim
mihi licet ei per vim imponere. Nam his qui rationis habent
usum libera esse debet utilium et inutilium electio, nisi alteri
jus quoddam in eos quaesitum sit. Infantium plane alia cst viggrtelnct.

so that man is not a slave by nature, but he is not by nature a erea-
ture that cannot be a slave. For in this latter sense, no one is
free. And to this view pertains what is said by Albutius, that No
one is born free, and πο one is born a slave; these names came
afterwards to belong to men by their fortune. So Aristotle says,
that it is a result of law that one man is free, another a slave.
Thercfore they who have, by a legitimate course, come into slavery‚
either persona] or civil, ought to be content with their conditiou3 as
St Paul teaches, Art thou called beiny a servant? Care not for it.
1 Cor. vii. 21.

XII. Nor is it lcss unjust to wish to subjugate any by arms, as
being worthy to bc slaves, or as philosophers sometimes speak, natu-
rally slaves. For even if there bc anything which is fit for me, it
does not follow that any one has a right to impose it on me by
force. For those who have the use of reason, ought to have a free
election left them of what is useful to them and what is not, except
another have a right over them. The case is plainly different with
infants, the governmcnt of whom, since they themselves have not the
:right of independcnt aetion and sels-direction, nature gives to those
who have a claim to it, and can exercise it.

XIII. 1 It would hardly be necessary to notice that the title
given by some to the Roman Emperor is absurd, as if he had the right
of ruling over the most remote and hitherto unknown pcoples3 cx-
cept Dartolus, who was long held the princ-0 of jurists, had ventured
