CAP. X.] EX DOMINIO ORITUR. 27

addenda mihi videtur exceptio, dnisi quatenus dominus rei

suae possessionem recipere sine impendio aliquo probabiliter
non potuit, ut puta si res apud piratas fuerit. Tunc enim
deduci poterit quantum dominus impensurus libenter fuerat:
ipsa enim facti possessio, praesertim reeuperatu difficilis, est
aliquid aestimabile, et in hoe dominus post rem amissam een-
setur factus locupletior. Et ideo cum rei suae emtio ordi· L-Se1ce‚16-

IX. 1 Seventhly, a thing belonging to another which has been
bona fide bought, is to be restored, and the price paid cannot be
demanded back*. To which rule it seems to me that this exception
should be made 3—except in so far as the owner could not probably
recover possession of his thing without some expense3 as, for ex-
ample, if it were in the hands of pirates: for then we may deduet as
much as the owner would willingly have expended on it. For the
actual possession of a thing, especially of a thing difficult to recover,
is of itself a valuable matter, and in this the owner, after he has lost
the thing [and recovered it] is richer than he was before. And there-
fore though the buying of a thing which is one's own is not valid by
ordinary law, yet Paulus says that it is valid, if it be agreed from the
first that the possession which another has of it may be bought. Nor
do I here require that the thing should be bought with a purpose
of restoring it to the owner, in which case an aetion for agency
would lie. Some hold one way, some the other. For the action for
agency is the creation of the Civil Law, and has none of those foun-
dations by means of which nature induces obligation. And we are
here inquiring what is Natural LaW.

2 Ulpian's opinion respecting funeral expensos is of the same
kind 3 that a just judge in such cases does not merely imitate the effect
of an aetion for agency, but follows equity in a larger manner, the
