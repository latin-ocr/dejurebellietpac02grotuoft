historiis legimus legatos a suscepto itinere domum rediisse
deserta legatione, quod res ita mutatas intelligerent, ut tota
legationis materia aut causa cessaret.

spoken. Thus we constantly read in history of ambassadors who
gave up their commission and returned home, because they under-
stood that the state of things was changed, so that the whole matter
or cause of the embassy ceased.

XXVI. 1 The repugnance of an occurring case with the will
[of the promiser] is commonly, in writers on omtory, referred to the
Section of which 1 have spoken, Of what is said and what is meant.
It is twofold: for the will is either collected from natural reasons,
or from some other sign of the will. Aristotle, who has most cor-
rectly treated this part, ascribes to the intellect a peculiar power for
judging of the will, which he calls γνώμη, or εὐγνωμοσύνη, that is
equitable itzsi971t; and to the will he ascribes a corresponding
power, ἐπιείκεια, equity, which he ably defines, The correction of the
law, when it is defective from the universality of its expression*.
And this equity is also to be applied to testaments and compacts in
an appropriate manner. For since all cases ean neither be foreseen
nor expressed, there is a necessity for some liberty for excepting cases
which he who has spoken would except if he were present. But
this is not to be done rashly 3 (for that would be for the interpreter
