3 All which passages, however, are so to be understood that the
pcople or the king are not strictly bound to give up the person, but,
as we have said, to punish him. For thus we read that the Eleans
made war on the Lacedaemoniam, because they had not punished
those who had done injury to the Eleans3 that is, they neither punished
them nor gave them up. It is a disjunctive obligation.

4 Sometimes the option is given to those who demand the guilty,
that the satisfaction may be more complete. The Caerians, in Livy,
signify to the Romans that the Tarquinians passing through their
land with a small force, though thoy had askcd for nothing but a
passage, had drawn along with them some of the country pcople to
join them in the marauding practices of which they were accused:
that if it were wished that they should be given up, they were ready
to give them up3 if it were wished that they should be punished,
they were ready to punish them.

5 In the second lcaguc of the Carthaginians and Romans, which
is extant in Polybius, there is this passage (if rightly read): If noc,
let each pursue his own riyht by private proceedinqs: if this does not
succeed, Zet ic be considered α public delict. Eschines, in his answer to
