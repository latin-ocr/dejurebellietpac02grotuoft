que constare .· nam singtzcli quique conqreyati, vel in sum-

2 Pertinet autem culpa ad singulos qui consenserunt,
non ad eos qui aliorum sententiis victi sunt. Distinctae enim
sunt poenae singulorum et universitatis. Sicut singulorum

subit servitutem civilem in provinciam redacta. Singuli bona
sua amittunt confiscatione. Sic civitati adimi solent quae

aerarium, agri publici.

suum ea amittant, quae ipsorum sunt propria, injustum est, ut

recte ostendit Libanius in ea quae est de seditione Antiochena.

quae Libanius de hac re dicit et Chryso- Marcus Antoninus philosophus, ut testis
stomus in xvn. de statuis.- in eosdem est Capitolinus (cap. 25) et in By-

speak of the duties of subjects. There is ever. a participation of pun-
ishment by communication between the general body and individua153
for, as Augustino says, The yeneral body consists ofimlivz‘duals, διο.

2 But the fault lies at the door of the individuals who have con-
sented to the act, not to those who were outvoted by the others. For
the punishments of individuals and of the general body are different.
As the punishment of individuals is sometimes death, so it is the
punishment of a city to be destroyed, which is done when the civil
body is dissolved; of which case we have spoken elsewhere. And if
a city or state ccase to exist in this manner, Modestinus rightly said,
that the life-interest which any persons have in it ceases. Individuals
are reduced to slavory in the way of punishment, as the Thebans

under Alexander of Macedon: excepting those who had voted against Α

the proposal of making the alliance [with the Macedonians, Gn] So
also a city or state undergoes civil slavery, by being reduced into the
condition of a province. Individuals lose their goods by confiscation.
But [in punishing a city] the things which are taken from the city are
the public property3 as walls, arsenals, fleets, arms, elephants, its trea-
sury, and its public lands.
