locum habent leges etiam quae irritum aetum faciunt, ubi id

such paets are governed by Natural Law only3 as also the pacts of
sovereigns as such. For in the private aets of sovereigns, those laws
have place which make the act void, when it is in their favour, not

VI. 1 The discussion of paets mado in error* is suffieiently per-
plexed. For a distinction is commonly made between an error as to
the substance of a thing, and an error not about the substance: as,
whether fraud was the occasion of the contract: whether the person
with whom the eontraet was made was a party to the fraud: whether
it be an aetion stricti juris or honae fidei-iu For, according to these
variatiom, writers pronounce some acts void, others, valid, but open to
be rescinded. or remodellcd at the choico of him who is injurcd. But
the greater part of these distinctions come from the Roman Law,
both the old civil Law, and the decisions of Proet0rs; and some of
them are not sufficiently true or accurate.

ciple conccrning the force and efficacy of laws, which is received by
an almost universal consent2—-that if the law be founded on the pre-
sumption of some fact, which fact is really not so, then that law does
not obligo: because, the truth of the fact failing, the whole founda-
