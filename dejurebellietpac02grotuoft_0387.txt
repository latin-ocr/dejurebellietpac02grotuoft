CAP. XXL] DE POENARUM COMMUNICATIONE. 361

Idem llTheodosii probat factum, qui commune delictum pu-
nierat interdictione theatri, balneorum, nominis metropo-
litani.

VIII. 1 Egregia hic occurrit quaestiO, an poena ob de-
lictum universitatis semper exigi possit. Quamdiu durat uni-
versitas, videtur posse, quia idem corpus manet, quanquam
particulis succedentibus, ut alibi ostensum est. Sed ex ad-
verso notandum est, quaedam de universitate dici primo ac
per se, ut habere aerarium, leges, et similia: quaedam non
nisi derivatione a singulis, Sic namque doctam dicimus uni- gusta-nrm.
versitatem et fortem, quae plurimos habet tales. De hoc '
genere est meritum : primo enim convenit singulis, ut animum
habentibus quem universitas per se non habet. Extinctis
ergo illis per quod ad universitatem meritum deducebatur,
ipsum quoque meritum extinguitur, ae proinde et poenae debi-
tum, *quod sine merito diximus non consistere. Libanius in
dicta oratione: ἐμοὶ μὲν ’γάρ δοκεῖς ἀρκεῖν ἡγούμενος τό
μηκέτ’ εἶναι μηδένα τῶν ταῦτ’ ἠδικηκότων· ita enim ex-
zantinos Seyerus, demto theatro, ther· Herodianum (Lib.111. αδ. n.19. Edit.

account of a delict of the general body, committed without their con·
sent, is unjust: as Libanius rightly shews on the sedition of Antioch.
The same writer approves an aet of Theodosius, who punished a public
offense by interdicting the theatro, the public baths, and the title of
metropolis.

VIII. 1 This important question occurs, whether punishment
may always be exacted for tho delicts of the general body. So long
as the constitution of the body continues, it would seem that it can,
because the same body remains, though preserved by a succession of
different particles, as we have elsewhere shewn. But, on the con-
trary side, it is to be observed that some things are asserted of the
body primarily and per se, as to have a treasury, laws, and the 1ike3
others only derivatively from its members. Thus we call a body
learned and bravo, which has many learned and bravo members. And
desert [of punishment, G.] is of this kind; for, in the first place, it
belongs to individuals, as having a spirit and intelligenee which the
body by itself has not. Therefore if these persons be extinct, from
whom desert was deduced and carried to the account of the body, the
desert is extinct, and also the desert of punishment3 which, as we
have said, cannot exist without desert. So Libanius says: Itmuse
suffice you as το punishment, that πο one is Icfl os those who offencled.
