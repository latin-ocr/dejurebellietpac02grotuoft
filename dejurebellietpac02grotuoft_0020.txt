10 QUANDO IMPERIA VEL [Lm. 11.

unde parata est responsio ad controversiam ex facto nonnun-
quam agitatam, quo loco in conventibus sedere debeat qui
summum imperium in populum ante liberum accepit: eodem
nimirum quo ipse populus: sicut in Amphictyonico consessu
Phocensium 3locum accepit Philippus Macedo: sic vicissim qui
regis fuerat locus, eum populus liber implebit.

IX. Quod si quando quniantur duo populi, non amitten-
tur jura, sed communicabuntur, sicut Sabinorum primo, deinde
Albanorum jus in Romanos transfusum est, et una facta res-
publica, ut Livius loquitur. Idemque censendum de regnis,
quae non foedere, aut eo duntaxat quod regem communem ha-
beant, sed vera unitate junguntur.

X. Contra evenit, ut quae una civitas fuerat dividatur,
aut consensu mutuo, aut vi bellica, sicut corpus imperii Persici
divisum est in Alexandri successores. Quod cum fit, plura pro
uno existunt summa imperia, cum suo jure in partes singulas.
Si quid autem commune fuerit, id aut communiter est admini-
strandum, aut pro ratis portionibus dividendum. Huc refe-

now to be exercised by the body, but by the head. And hence we see
what answer is to be made to a controversy which sometimes arises
from circumstances ; In what place in a convention ought he to sit who
has acquired the sovereignty over a people free before: as in the
Amphictyonie council, Philip of Macedon had the place which the
Phoceans had had. And so on the other hand, the place which had
belonged to the king, shall be filled by the people, made free..

IX. If at any time two Peoples are united, their rights will not be
lost, but imparted by each to the other3 as the rights, first of the
Sabines, and afterwards of the Albans, were imparted to the Romans,
and they were made one republic, as Livy speaks. The same is to be
conceived of kingdoms which are united, not by league, nor only
because they have a common king, but joined by a real union.

X. It may happen, on the contrary, that what had been one State
is divided, either by mutual consent, or by war3 as the body of the
Persian empire was divided among the successors of Alexander. When
this happens, there are several sovereignties in'the place of one, each
having its rights over the separate parts. If there was anything
