196 DE DAMNO PER INJURIAM DATO, ET [Lm.11.

XlX. At gentium consensu sicut introductum est, ut bella.
omnia summae potestatis auctoritate utrinque gesta et indicta
pro justis habeantur, quoad effectus externos, qua de re infra
dicemus: ita et hoc, ut talis belli metus hactenus pro justo
habeatur, ne quod ita obtentum est repeti possit. Atque hoc
sensu admitti potest distinctio Ciceronis, inter hostem, quicum
multa jura habemus, ut aitsoommunia, cx gentium consensu
scilicet, et piratas ac latrones. Nam hi si quid metu expres-
serunt repeti potest, nisi jusjurandum intercesserit: quod illi,
non item. Quare quod Polybio videtur justam fuisse Cartha-
giniensibus eausam belli Punici secundi, quod Romani ab ipsis
mercenariorum seditione occupatis bello denuntiato Sardiniam
insulam et pecuniam expressissent, habet naturalis aequitatis
aliquam speciem, sed ajure gentium abit, ut alibi explicabitur.

XX. 1 Ex neglectu tenentur reges ac magistratus, qui
ad inhibenda latrocinia et piraticam non adhibent ea quae pos-
sunt ac debent remedia: quo nomine damnati olim ab Am-
phictyonibus Scyrii. Quaesitum memini ex facto, cum patriae
nostrae rectores potestatem praedarum in mari ex hoste agen-
darum per codicillos plurimis dedissent, et eorum nonnulli res

 

an involuntary aet arising from a voluntary one is held morally for a
voluntary one.

XIX. As, by the consent of nations, a rule has been introduced,
that all wars, conducted on both sides by authority of the sovereign
power, are to be held just wars3 so this also has been established, that
the fear of such a war is held a justly imposed fear, so that what is
obtained by such means cannot be demanded back. And here the
distinction appears between an enemy and pirates or robbers ἧς, For
what these take, may be demanded back, except an oath have been

introduced to prevent it3 what those take, not so. Wherefore, what ⁷

appears to Polybius to be a just cause for the Carthaginians beginning
the second Punic war, that the Romans had before made war upon
them when they were engaged with the mutiny of their mercenarios,
and had wrung from them the island of Sardinia, and a money pay-
ment, has some shew of natural equity, but is at variance with the
Law of Nations, as we shall elsewhere explain.

XX. 1 Kings and magistrates are liable for neglect, who do not
apply the remedies which they can and ought, to restrain robbery and
piracy: on which ground the Scyrians were in ancient times con-
demned by the Amphictyons. I recollect the question being pro-
posed to me,—from the fact when the rulers of our country had given

* And so the connexion between “private war'' and public war disappears. ΠΥ.
