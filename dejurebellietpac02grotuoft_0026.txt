16 QUANDO IMPERIA VEL [L113.11.

pependerat) placuit populo Romano, quo certius praesidium
haberet, regem non proprium sibi sumere, sed eum quem
Germani fecissent: dita tamen ut jus sibi aliquod retineret
probandae vel improbandae electionis, quantum scilicet ea res
ad se pertinebat.

4 Haec quoque approbatio per episcopum edici et solem—
niter testata fieri peculiari coronatione solebat: quare ex elec-
tione septem principum, qui Germaniae corpus referunt, qui
lectus est, jus habet imperandi Germanis secundum eorum mo-
res: ex approbatione vero populi Romani fit idem reX, aut
Imperator Romanus, aut, ut historici saepe loquuntur, eRex
regni Italiae: atque eo titulo sub se habet quaecumque populi
Romani fuerunt, neque pactionibus, aut derelicti occupatione,
aut victoriae jure in aliorum populorum imperium concesserunt:

of Rome, in order that they might- be sure of a protector, not to
have a king of their own, but the king whom the Germans had elected:
yet so that they might retain some power of confirming or annulling
the election, so far as they were concerned.

4 This approbation was wont to be proclaimed by the Bishop, and
solemnly celebrated by a special coronation, [that of King of the Ro-
mana] Wherefore he who is elected by the Seven Princes who re-

present Germany, has authority to rule over the Germans according ,

to their usages. But the same person is, by the approbation of the
Roman people, made Roman Emperor, or King, or, as historians often
speak, King of the kingdom of Italy. And by that title, he has under
him whatever belonged to the people of Rome, and that has not passed
under the authority of other peoples by compact, or by occupation of
derelict, or by the right of conquest.

And hence we easily understand by what right the Bishop of
Rome, during the vacancy of the Empire, gives the investitures of
the fiefs of the Roman Empire3 namely, because he is the first person
in the Roman people, which at that time is free. For whatever
office belongs to any body, is wont to be discharged by the first person
of that body, as we have elsewhere said.
