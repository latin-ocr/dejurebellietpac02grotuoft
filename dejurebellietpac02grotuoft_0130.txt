114 DE EORUM QUI SUMMUM IMPERIUM [L113.11.

fieri, aut omnino, aut ex parte, quia eatenus populus jus sibi
servavit. Dc iis autem actibus regum qui pleno jure regnant,
sed regnum non ut proprium possident, quibus regnum aut
regni pars aut res fiscales alienantur, egimus supra, et ostendi-
mus hos actus ipso naturae jure nullos esse, ut factos de re
aliena.

2 At privati actus regis considerandi sunt, non ut actus
communitatis, sed ut actus partis, ac proinde facti eo animo,
ut communem legum regulam sequantur. Unde etiam leges,
quae actus quosdam aut simpliciter, aut si is qui laesus est velit,
irritos faciunt, locum et hic habebunt, quasi sub ea conditione
contractum foret. Sic videmus reges quosdam adversus foene-
bre malum sibi consuluisse juris remediis.v Poterit tamen rex
ut aliorum ita suos actus his legibus solvere3 quod an facere
voluerit, ex circumstantiis erit aestimandum. Si fecerit, judi-
canda res erit ex mero jure naturali. Hoc addendum, si quae
lex actum irritum faciat, non in favorem agentis, sed in
poenam, hanc in regum actibus locum non habituram, 2ut nec

rights, but is under additional legal constraints, acts contrary to
these laws may be by them made void 3 either altogether, or in part3
because to this extent the people had retained a right to itself. In
the case of kings who reign with plenary rights, but have not the
kingdom as their own property, such acts of theirs as alienate the
kingdom or a part thereof, or its revenues, have been discussed above3
and wo have shewn that such acts are by Natural Law void, as acts
done to the property of another.

2 But the private acts of the king are to be considered, not as the
acts of the community, but as acts of a private party, and conse-
quently, done with the intention of following the common rule of laiv.

Wherefore the laws which make some acts void, either absolutely, or “

if the person injured by them demands that they should be so, hold
here also3 as if the contract had been made under that condition.
And accordingly we have seen certain kings protect themselves in this
way against the evil of usury *. But the king may release his own
acts, as he may those of others, from these laws: and whether he
intends to do this, is to be estimated from the circumstances. If he
does, the matter must then be judged by mere Natural Law. This is

who repudiated a portion of his debts in 1596: and refers to Mezeray, B.xx·111.
Barbeyrac adds, on the same authority, that two years after, Philip revoked this
act, and aclmowledged his deth.
