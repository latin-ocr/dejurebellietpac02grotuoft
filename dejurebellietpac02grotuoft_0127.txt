CAP. XIIL] DE JUREJURANDO. 111

Laudat oratione pro Deiotaro Cicero C. Caesaris dexte- caps

ram, nou in bellis et praeliis, quam in promissis et fide firmio-
rem. Et heroicis temporibus sceptrum erectum pro regum
jurejurando valuisse notatum Aristoteli.

 

Eumenes, that they would sooner forfeit their life than their word: as
also Gunter says to Ligurinus.

Cicero in his oration for Deiotarus, praises Cesar by saying that
his hand was as firm iu pledging truth as in fighting battles. And in
the heroic tImes, a sceptrc was set up as the kingâ€™s oath, as Aristotle
notes.

Pol. ii
