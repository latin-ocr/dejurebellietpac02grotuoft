eminentis dominii, primum requiritur utilitas publica3 deinde,
ut si fieri potest compensatio fiat ei qui suum amisit, ex com-
muni. Hoc ergo sicut in rebus aliis locum habet, ita et in
jure quod ex promisso aut contractu quaeritur.

Vffl. Neque ullo modo hic admittenda est distinctio quam
adferunt nonnulli, juris quaesiti ex vi juris naturalis, ⁶et ejus
quod venit ex lego civili3 nam in utrumvis par jus est regiS,
nec hoc magis quam illud sine causa tolli potest. Ubi enim
dominium aut jus aliud alicui legitimo modo partum est, id ne
sine causa ei auferatur juris est naturalis. Contra si rex fa-
ciat, haud dubie tenetur reparare damnum datum: facit enim
contra verum jus subditi. Hoc ergo differt jus subditorum et
jus exterorum, quod jus exterorum (hoc est qui nulla ratione
subditi sunt) supereminenti dominio nullo modo subest: nam
de poena infra videbimus: subditorum autem jus ei dominio
subest, quatenus publica utilitas desiderat.

But to do this by the force of Emincnt Dominion, there is required, in
the first place, public utility3 and next, that, is possible, compensation
be made, to him who has lost what was his, at the common expense.
And as this holds with regard to other matters, so does it with regard
to rights which are acquired by promise 01· contract.

VIII. Nor may we, in this matter, in any way admit the dis-
tinction which some make, between rights acquircd by force of Natural
LaW, and those which come from the Civil LaW. For the right of
the king over the one class and the other is equal, and the latter can-
not, any more than the former, be taken away without cause. For
when owncrship, or any other right, has been legitimately acquircd
by any one, that it may not be taken away from him without cause,
is a matter of Natural LaW. If the king act in any other way, he is
without doubt bound to repair the damage done: for he acts against
the true right of the subject. In this therefore the rights of subjects
and the rights of foreigners differ. That the rights of foreigncrs‚ (that
is, of those who arc not subjects in any way,) are by no means sub-
ject to the right of Eminent Dominion; (whether thoy are subject to
Penalty, we shall hei-caster see 3) but the rights of subjects are liable
to that right, so far as public utility demands.

IX. From what wc have said, this also appears 2—-how false that
is which some deliver, that the Contracta of Kings are Laws. For, from
