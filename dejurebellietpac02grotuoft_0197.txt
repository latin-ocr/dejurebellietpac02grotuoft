CAP. XVI.] DE IN TERPRETATION E. 1 79

XXIII. Secundum, ex eo quod contentum in promissione,
ubi ratio talis additur, aut de ea constat, non consideratur
nude, sed quatenus sub ea ratione venit.

XXIV. Tertium, in eo quod materia de qua agitur sem-
per intelligenda est observari animo loquentis, etiamsi verba
latius pateant. Haec quoque interpretandi ratio a Rhetoribus
tractatur in 1000 περὶ ῥητοῦ καὶ διανοίας, et titulum habet,
cum dicitur non semper eadem sententia.

XXV. 1 Sed de ratione notandum est, sub ca compre-
hendi saepe quasdam res non secundum existentiam, sed secun-
dum potentiam moraliter consideratam, quae ubi locum habet,
restrictio facienda non est. Sic si cautum sit, ne exercitus aut
classis aliquo ducatur, non poterit duci, etiam animo non no-
cendi. Quia in pactione non certum damnum, sed periculum

qualecunque spectatum est.
2 Solet et hoe disputari, an promissa in se habeant taci-

tam conditionem‚ si res maneant quo sunt loco: quod negan-
dum est, nisi apertissime pateat statum rerum praesentem in

sint3 et in iis quae Johannes Justiniane- Misc. e. 23.]

XXIII. The second in this, that what is contained in the pro.
mise, when such a reason is added, or the reason is certain, is not
considered nakedly, but so far as it comes under that reason.

XXIV. The third in this, that the matter which is dealt with is
always supposed to be present to the mind of the speaker (tho pro-
miser)‚ although the words have a wider signification. This way of
interpretation also is treated by writers on Rhetorie in the Section, Of
what is said ancl what z's meant ; and has for its Title, lVlzen the same
words are used, but ‘not in the same sense.

XXV. 1 But with regard to the reasons [of promisers‚ as hero
applied], it is to be noted that there are eomprehended therein many
things, not as to whether they exist, but as to their power morally
considered3 and when this holds, the restriction is not to be intro-
duced. Thus if it be stipulated that an army or a ficet is not to bo
moved into a certain place, it must not be moved thither, though it
be done with no purpose of attack. For in the eompact, it was not
a certain damage, but a danger of any kind which was considered.

2 This also is often disputed, whether promises have in them-
selves this tacit condition, If things remain in their present state.
And this is to be denied, except it be quite clear that the present
