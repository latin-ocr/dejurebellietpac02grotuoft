1 68 DE INTERPRETATIONE. [Lm. 11.

quando per id fedus novos socios adsciscere liceret. Atque
eam sententiam secuti sunt Athenienses postea, imperato suis,
ne in Corinthios pugnarent, nisi ubi ii descendere pararent
hostiliter in Corcyram, aut in aliquod solum ditionis Corcy-
rensium, ne scilicet fedus rumperent. Non pugnat autem
cum federe, ut quos alii offenderent, hi defenderentur ab
aliis, ⁰manente de caetero pace. J ustinus de his temporibus
agens: Inducias, quas proprio nomine condioeerant, ex
sociorum persona rumpebant, quippe quasi minus perjurii
contraherent, si ferentes sociis auxilia potius quam si aperto
proelio dimicassent. Sic et in oratione de Haloneso, quae
inter Demosthenicas legitur, apparet pace quadam Athenien-
sium cum Philippo cautum, ut quae ea pace non comprehen-
derentur Graeciae civitates liberae essent: si quis vim inferret,
defendere eas in pace comprehensis liceret. Et hoc quidem
exemplum est in federe aequali.

XIV. In federe inaequali ponemus alterum, si convenerit
ne alter federatorum injussu alterius bellum gerere possit3

And this opinion the Athenians themselves afterwards followed3 for
they gave command to their officers that they should not fight against
the Corinthians, except they attacked Corcyra, or invaded its soil, in
order not to break the league. For it is not at variance with a league,
that they who are attacked by one party should be defended by the
other, peace remaining as to other matters. J ustin says, of these events,
that lec treaty which they had made in their own name, they broke in the
person of their allies, ‹5⁰- So in the Oration on Halonesus, it appears
that, by the peace between the Athenians and Philip, it was pro-
vided that the cities of Greece, not comprehended in that treaty,
should be free; and if any one attacked them, those comprehended
in the peace might defend them. And this is an example in an equal
league. Δ

XIV. In an unequal league we shall suppose other terms: that
it is agreed that neither of the allies shall make war without permis-
sion of the other: which were the terms of the league of the Romans
and Carthaginians, after the second Punic war, as mentioned above:
