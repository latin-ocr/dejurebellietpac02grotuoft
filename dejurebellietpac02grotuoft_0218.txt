198 DE DAMNO PER INJURIAM DATO, ET [LIB.II.

ex quo dijudicanda essct haec controversia, sed juris civilis,
nec generalis, scd adversus nautas et alios quosdam ex ratio-
nibus peculiaribus introductum. Atque in eam partem a su-
premi auditorii judicibus contra Pomeranos quosdam pronun-
tiatum est, idque ad exemplum rerum in causa non dispari,
ante duo saecula, judicatarum.

XXI. Illud quoque notandum est, ut mancipium aut ani-
mal quod damnum, aut pauperiem fecit, noxae dedatur, itidem
ex jure civili esse. ³Nam dominus, qui in culpa non est, na-
tura ad nihil tenetur: ut nec is, cujus navis sine ipsius culpa
navi alterius damnum dedit: quamquam multorum populorum
legibus, ut et nostra, damnum tale dividi solet ob culpae pro-
bandae difficultatem.

XXII. Sed damnum, ut diximus, etiam adversus honorem
et famam datur, puta verberibus, contumeliis, maledictis, ca-

testimony both of France and England: that any one, without any
fault of 1115 own, is bound by the acts of his agents, is not a part of
the Law of Nations3 by which 11115 controversy must be decided, but
a part of the Civil Law3 nor of that in general, but introduced
against sailors, and certain others, for peculiar reasons. And sentence
was given to that effect by the J udges of the Supremo Court‚ against
certain Pomeranians; and that, according to the precedent of a similar
cause, adjudged two centuries ago.

XXI. It is to be noted also that the rule, that if a slave, or any
animal, cause any damage or loss, it creates a liability in the master,
is also a creation of Oivil Law. For the master, who is not in fault,
is not liable by Natural Law ; as also he is not whose ship, without
any fault of his, damages another's ship: although by the laws of
many nations, and by ours, the damage in such case is commonly
divided, on account of the difficulty of proving where the fault lay.

XXII. Damagcs also, as we have said, may be inflicted on a
man’s honour or reputation; as with blows, insults, abusive language,
calumny, ridicule, and the like. In which cases, no less than in theft,
and other offenses, the badness or malice of the act must be dis-
tinguished from the damage. For the badness of the act is a ground
for punishment, the loss, for reparation: which, in this case, is made
