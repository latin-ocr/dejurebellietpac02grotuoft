Car. X.] EX DOMINIO ORITUR. 23

tatem, ut evidentissimam, provocantes Ex actu servi insti- {infissgi‘iib

toris tenetur qui praeposuit, ita nisi denunciaverit ne ei cre· ssgcflfflfw‘·

deretur: At etiam si sit facta denunciatio, et servus ex eo
contractu peculium habeat, aut in rem domini versum sit,
replicabitur de dolo. Videtur enim, inquit Proculus, dolam
malum facere, qui αν aliena jactura lucrum quaerac. Ubi
doli mali vox id omne significat, quod naturali juri et {equitati
repugnat.

Qui matre jubente pro filii defensore fidejussit, adver· {lagg-affig-

sus defensorem mandati actionem non habet, nec proprie ejus
gessit negotium, quia contemplatione matris fidejussit: Atta-
men ex Papiniani sententia dabitur actio negotiorum gestorum
(utilis, ni fallor) in defensorem, quia pecunia fidejussoris
liberatur.

Sic uxori quae marito pecuniam donavit, quam ex lege 5125- ¹ss·d³e¹“r·

posset repetere, datur condictitia aut utilis vindicatio in rem gj‘fflgssfffir·

ex pecunia comparatam3 quia, inquit Ulpianus, locupletiorem
esse maritum negari non potest: et hoc quaeritur, quid ex re
mulieris possideat.

Si consumseris nummos quos mihi meus servus surripue- ggcffigrgfr·

of profit go to the master, his warning is not held good. For, says
Proculus, hc appears to act fiuudulently (dolo malo) who tries to yet
yain by tlte loss of others (the servant's creditors); where dolus malus
means anything contrary to natural right and equity.

If a friend, at the request of the mother, have advanced money for
the son's agent, he has not properly an action against the agent, for
commission discharged or work done 3 nor was it properly the agent's
work which he did3 for it was in regard to the mother that he gave
his money3 yet, according to Papinian, there will lie an (indirect)
action for work done, against the agent, because he has been liberated
from rcsponsibility by the money of the friend.

If a wife have given money to her husband, which she could by
law call back again, she has an action cstablishing her claim to that
which has been bought with the money: for, says Ulpian, it cannot be
denied that thc husband is the richer by the proceediug: and there
is to be an inquiry what he possessos which is his wifc’s.

If money, which my servant stolo from me, you have spent, think-
ing that it was his own property, I have an action against you, as if my
property had come into your hands without any just title to it.
