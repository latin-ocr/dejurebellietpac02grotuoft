381⁴ DE OAUSIS INJUSTIS. .[L113.II.

V. 1 Metum ergo ex vicina potentia non sufficere supra
diximus. Ut enim justa sit defensio, necessariam esse oportet,
qualis non est nisi constet, non tantum de potentia, sed et de
animo, et quidem ita constet, ut certum id sit ea certitudine

quse in morali materia locum habet.

2 Quare minime est probanda eorum sententia, qui justam
belli eausam statuunt, si vicinus nulla pactione impeditus in suo
arcem faciat, aut munitionem aliam quae damnum aliquando
dare possit. Nam adversus tales metus contrariae in suo mu-
nitiones et siqua sunt similia remedia quaerenda sunt, non vis

V. 1 That sear from a neighbouring power is not a sufficient
cause, we have said above. For, that defense may be just, it must
be necessary; and it cannot be this, except there bc clear evidence,
not only of the power, but of the animus of the party3 and such
evidence as amounts to moral certainty.

2 Hence we can by no means approve the opinion of those
who hold it to be a just cause of war, if a neighbour, being prevented
therefrom by no pact, establish a fortress on his own ground, or
any other munition of war, which may possibly at some time be mis-
chievous to us. For the proper remedies against such fears are
opposing munitions, and the like, not force of arms. Therefore
unjust were the wars of the Romans against Philip of Macedon, and
of Lysimachus against Demetrius, except there were some other
reason. I am much pleased with what Tacitus says of the Chauci ι
The most noble people among] the Germaus, and α people that prefers

quiet and retired. They provehe ‘no uvars, they practise rno robbery
or ptunder of their uet'yhbours ‚· and the yreut proof of their virtue and
their strenyth is, that it is not by wrouy-doing] that they preserve their
superiortty. Yet they can promptly use arms, and if need be, raise
armies.- they are numerous iu iiifcmtry and cavalry, and retain their
