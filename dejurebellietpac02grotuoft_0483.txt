CAP.XXV1.] DE OAUSIS JUSTIS UT BELLUM, ETC. 457

rum vitae parcere eum possit, omnino nolit, subditi illi tueri
se possint ex jure naturae, quod gentium jure ademptum illis
non est

2 Neque tunc dicemus bollum utrinque justum esse: non
enim de bollo, sed de certa ae definita actione quaeritur.
Illa autem actio, quamvis de cetero jus ad bellum habentis,
injusta est, et proinde juste repellitur.

 

that though he could save the lives of the subjeets of his adversar-y,
ho will not3 those subchts may defend themselves by the law of
nature, which they are not divested of by the law of nations.

2 Nor shall wo then say that tho war is just on both side53 for
tho question is not concerning the justice of tho war, but concerning
a certain and definito aetion of the enemy. And this action, though
it be the action of a person having in other respects a right of making
war, is uhjust, and therefore may be justly repelled.
