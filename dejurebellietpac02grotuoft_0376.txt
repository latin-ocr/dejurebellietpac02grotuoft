350 DE POENARUM COMMUNICATIONE. [Lm. II.

de paee Graeciae‚ dixisse inter alia, aequum esse ut poenas
luerent commissorum criminum non civitates, sed qui peccas-

6 Inter mala quae ex discordiis civitatum nascuntur et

7 Hic de deditis occurrit quaestio‚ an si a sua civitate
dediti, nec recepti sint ab aliis, cives maneant. Non manere

expulisse ex civitate sua. videretur, sicut faceret cum aqua et
igni interdiceret. 3Contrariam sententiam defendit Brutus,
et post eum Cicero: quae et verior est, non tamen proprie ob

lates that when they discoursed with Philip on the peace of Greece‚
he said, among other things, that it was just that the punishment of
the crimes which were committed should fall, not on the cities, but on
the offenders: and that the cities who should bring to judgment the
persons accused, ought not to be harmed. (Quintilian says, These are
oze-rt door to deserters who harbour deserters *.)

6 Among the evils which arise from the discords of states, Dio
Chrysostom puts this ε It is possible that those who have injur-ed one city,
to fly to another.

7 There occurs the question, of persons given up, if they are given
up by one state, and not accepted by the other, do they remain
citizens ?

P. M. Scaevola held that they did not: since when the people
had given up a person, it was as if they had expelled him from the
city, as if they had interdicted him from fire and water. Brutus, and
after him Cicero, defend the opposite opinion. And this is the
sounder opinion3 not, however, properly for the reason which Cicero
