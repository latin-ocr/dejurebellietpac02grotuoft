CAP. XIV] HABENT PROMISSIS, ETO. 115

alias leges poenales et quiequid vim habet cogendi. Nam
punitio et coactio non possunt procedere nisi a voluntatibus
diversis: itaque cogens et coactum requirunt distinctas per-
sonas, neque sufficiunt distincti respectus.

III. J uramentum autem Rex irritum reddere antece-
denter potest ut privatus, si se ipse potestate tale quid jurandi
plane privaverit priore juramento: consequenter non potest,
quia hic quoque personarum distinctio requiritur. Nam quae
consequenter irrita redduntur, jam antea exceptionem in se
habebant, nisi superior noluerit: at ita jurare ut tenearis nisi
ipse nolis, perabsurdum est, et naturae jurisjurandi eontrarium.
Etsi vero ex jurejurando jus quaeri alteri non possit, ob aliquod
vitium in persona, tamen eum qui juraverit Deo obstringi
supra ostendimus: quod ad reges non minus quam ad alios
· pertinet, eontra quam sentit dicto loco Bodinus.

lV. Promissa quoque plena, et absoluta, atque acceptata,
naturaliter jus transferre demonstratum supra est, quod itidem

ad reges non minus quam ad alios pertinet, ita ut improbanda ἓξὲξ, 3³1}— ae

to be added3 that if any law make an aot void, not in favour of the
doer, but as a penalty on him, this does not hold against the acts of
kings3 as in other matters also, pena-l laws, and all which has a power
of coercion do not apply to them. For punishment and eoereion
can only proceed from diversity of will: the coercer and the coerced
require distinct persons3 distinct relations [of the same person] are
not sufficient.

III. A king, as a private person, may nullify an oath, antece-
clently, if by a prior oath he deprive himself of the power of swearing
to such an effect3 but consequently, [after the act,] he cannot do this
[by his royal authorityz] for here too a distinction of persons is
required. For the oaths which are nullified subsequently to the act,
were already understood to be made with the exception, “ except a
superior refuse his consent ;’' but to swear in such a sense, that you
are bound, except you yourself refuse consent, is absurd, and contrary
to the nature of an oath. But although a right may not bc acquired by
another person in virtue of the oath, on account of some defect in the
person who swears, yet that he is bound to God, we have shown
above: and this applies to kings no less than to others; contrary to
the sentiments of Bodinus in the place cited.

IV. Also Promises, when full, absolute, and accepted, naturally
transfer a right, as we have shewn ab0v03 and this likewise applies to
