erat, teneri negaverat: itaque publico consilio aliud de integro
fedus factum erat.

2 Videndum deinde, an praeter silentium res aliqua
accesserit: nam sine re aut facto aliquo silentium non satis
probabilem voluntatis conjecturam suppeditat, ut ex his, quae
de dominii derelictione supra diximus, intelligi potest. Sed
si actus aliqui accesserint, qui ad aliam causam probabiliter
referri nequeant, tum recte intelligitur actus ratus esse habitus:
modo probatum id qnod cum Gaditanis convenerat, notat
Cicero pro Balbo.

3 Silentium adversus Carthaginienses urgebant Romani,
de pactione eum Asdrubale faeta. Sed cum illa pactio verbis
concepta essct negantibus, ne Poeni amnem Iberum transirent,
vix erat ut silentium solum ad inducendam ratihabitionem
facti alieni valeret, quippe eum factum proprium nullum secu-
tum esset, nisi aliquando Poenus Iberum transire volens pro-
hibitus a Romanis esset, eorumque dicto Poeni paruissent:
talis enim actus vim habet actus positivi, nec manet intra

2 We must next see whether, besides silence, any other circum-
stance has been added. For silence, without some thing or act, does
not supply a sufficiently probable conjecture of the will; as may be
understood by what we have said above, of the dereliction of owner-
ship. But if any act have been added which cannot be probably
referred to another cause, then the act of convention is rightly under-
stood to be accepted as valid. And so the convention with the Gadi-
tani was proved valid, as Cicero notes.

3 The Romans urged silence against the Carthaginians in refer-
ence to the convention made with Asdrubal. But since that conven-
tion was conceived in negative expressions—that the Carthaginians
should not pass the Ebro—it was scarcely a case in which silence
alone could establish a ratification of the act of another: since no act
of theirs had followed, except it might be that some Carthaginians,
wishing to pass the Ebro, had been prevented by the Romans, and
the Carthaginians had aequiesced: for such an act has the force of a
positive act, and is not merely negative. But if the pact of Lutatius
had had more parts, and it appeared that the other parts, though
dissenting from common rule, had been observed by the Romans, then
there would be a sufficient proof of the confirmation of the con-
vention.
