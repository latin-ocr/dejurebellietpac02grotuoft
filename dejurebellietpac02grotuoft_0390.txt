operis mei vitio damnum datum in ea re, in qua jure meo
usus sum. Et alibi, multum ait interesse, utrum damnum

2 Sic parentum bonis confiscatis sentiunt quidem incom-
modum liberi, sed proprie ea poena non est, quia bona illa
illorum futura non erant, nisi a parentibus ad ultimum spiri-
tum essent conservata. Quod recte ab Alpheno notatum est,
cum ait patris poena amittere liberos id quod ab ipso perven-
turum esset ad eos: quae vero non a patre, sed a rerum
natura aut aliunde tribuerentur, ea manere incolumia. Sic
Themistoclis liberos eguisse scribit Cicero, nec iniquum putat,
ut eandem calamitatem ferant liberi Lepidi. quue ait anti-

a damage caused by consequence, another. Ι call that a damage
directly caused, by which any one is deprived of a proper right which
he has3 a damage by consequence, that by which any one has not
that which he would have had: namely, by the cessation of the con-
dition, without which his right cannot subsist. We have an example
in Ulpian: If in my ground I have opened a well, by which tho
springs which would have come to you are cut off: he denies that,
by the effect of my operations, a wrongful damage is done to you,
since Ι was using my own right in my own property. And in another
place, he says it makes a great diffcrence, whether any one suffer a. γ
1055, or be prevented in a gain which he was going on to enjoy. And
so Paulus says, that it is preposterous that we should be supposed to
have possessions before we have acquired them.

2 So when the goods of the parents arc confiscated, the children
feel the loss3 but that is not properly a punishment, because those
goods were not to become theirs, except their parents kept possession
of them till their last breath. Which is rightly noted by Alphenus,
when he says that by the punishment of the parent, the children lose
that which from him would have come to thcm3 but that which was
given them by the nature of things, or from any other source, they do
not lose. So Cicero says, that the children of Themistocles were in
absolute want, and he does not think it unjust that the children of
