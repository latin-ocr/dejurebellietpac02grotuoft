ditis comparantur. Nam par parem cogere non potest, nisi
ad id quod ex jure debetur stricte dicto. At superior cogere
potest eetiam ad alia, quae virtus quaelibet praecipit, quia in
jure proprio superioris, qua superior est, hoc est compre-
hensum. Sic in magna frumenti penuria cives cogi possunt,
quod habent, in medium conferre: quare et in nostra illa con-
troversia verius videtur, cogi posse civem, ut id faciat, quod
exigit caritas. Atque ita is quem dixi Phocion amicissimum
quendam sibi Nicoclem nomine demonstrans aiebat, huc malo-
rum ventum, ut si Alexander eum deposceret, ipse deden-
dum censeret.

IV. Subditis proximi, imo pares sunt in hoc, ut defendi
debeant socii, in quorum federe comprehensum id est, sive in
tutelam sese et fidem aliorum dederunt, sive mutua auxilia,
pacti sunt. Qui non repellit injuriam a socio, si potest, tam
est in vitio, quam ille qui facit, ait Ambrosius. Pactiones

corn, the citizens may be compellcd to contribute to the common
stock what each one has3 and thus, in this question before us, it seems
to be sound doctrine that the citizen may be compelled to do that
which charity requires*. And thus Phocion, whom I have already
mentioned, pointed outa very intimate friend of his, Nicoclcs by
name, and said that matters were come to such a miserable condition
that if Alexander demanded him, ho would be of opinion that he
ought to be given up.

IV. As parties whom we arc bound to defend, next to our sub-
jeets, come our allics. This is eomprehended in our engagement
with them, whether they have put themselves under the authority
and protection of others, or have contractcd for mutual aid. He wlco
does not repel an injur-yser an ally, {f he can, is in the wrong] as much,
as lie who does the injury, says Ainbrose. That such contracts are
not to be extended to warS‚ where there is no just cause for the war,
we have elsewhere said. And this is the reason why the Lacedaemo-

⁸ Itis quite extravagant to place the sacrifice of one's own life on a level with
other offices of charity. As Grotius himself has just said, (chap. xxn'. 6,) life is
the foundation of all enjoyment in this world, and the occasion of all the happi-
ness of another: and it must be only under peculiar circumstances that a man
can dispose of these possessions, as if they resembled other possessione. W.
