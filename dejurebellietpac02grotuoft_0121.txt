3 In personam ejus cui juratur actus dirigi potest tol-
lendo ab eo jus quod ei partum est3 aut etiam, si jus desit,
vetando ne quid ex tali juramento accipiat: idque duobus
modis, sive in poenam, sive ob publicam utilitatem, ex vi su-
pereminentis dominii. Atque hinc intelligi potest, si jurans
non ejusdem sit ditionis cum eo cui juratur, quid aut hujus
aut illius rectores possint circa jusjurandum. Ipse autem qui
juratus aliquid promisit nocenti qua talis est, puta piratae, non
potest jus promisso quaesitum poenae nomine ob id ipsum ei
auferre: quia tunc verba nullum haberent effectum, quod
omnino vitandum est. Similique de causa compensari non
poterit quod promissum est, cum jure quod ante erat contro-
versum, si post motam controversiam inita pactio fuerit.

of it. And on this ground may be defended the absolutioris from
oaths which were formerly granted by princes3 and are now, by the
consent of princes, for the sake of piety, granted by the governors of
the Church.

3 The act of the superior may be directed on the person of him
to whom the oath is made, by taking from him the right which he
has thus acquired: or even, if he have no right, by forbidding that
he receive anything in virtue of such oath: and that, in two ways,
either as a penalty, or for public utility, in virtue of his Eminent
Dominion. And hence it may be understood, if the swearer be not
under the same subjection as the person swern to, what the gover—
nor of each may do in respect to the oath.

*He who on oath has promised anything to a mischievous person.
as such, as for instance a robber, cannot take from him the promised
right on the ground of penalty: for then his words would have no
effect, which is by all means to be avoided.

In like manner what is promised cannot be given as a compensa-
tion for a right which was in controversy before, if the agreement took
place after the controversy began.

* These two rules refer to promises rather than oaths. W.
