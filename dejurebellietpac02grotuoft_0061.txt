the obligation, but the carrier of the obligatory inst1·ument; therefore
letters indicating consent may be carried by any one. &Vc must
distinguish also between a minister who is elected to make known the
promise, and him who is elected to make the promise. In the former
case, the revocation will have its force, even if it do not become known
to the minister: in the other ease, the revocation is void, because the
right of promising was dependent on tho will of the minister or agent,
which will, the revocation not being yet known, was free from all·
fault. So also in the former ease, the donation may be accepted, even
the donorbeing dead ; as being perfect on one side, although revocably:
as may be seen on a large scale in ambassadors: in the other case, the
donation cannot be accepted, because it was not really made, but only
ordered to be made.

2 But in a doubtful case, the will of the person who gives
the order is understood to be, that the order be fulfilled, except some
great change take place, as the death of the person ordering. But
there may be conjectures which may favour another judgrnent, which
are readily to be admitted, in order that a donation which was directed
to be made for a pious cause may subsist. And in like manner may
a controversy be decided which was once agitated, whether an aetion
will hold against the heir of a person cntrusted with such a charge,
