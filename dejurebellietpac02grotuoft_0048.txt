38 DE PR OMISSIS. [Lm. ΙΙ.

certo definiri: sed ex quotidianis actibus, aut etiam ex eo
quod communiter in quaque regione accidit, desumendum est.
Itaque apud Hebraeos valebat promissio quam fecisset adole-
scens qui annum implesset decimum tertium: puella quae
duodecimum. Alibi leges civiles, justa ratione motae, quas-
dam promissiones pupillorum ae minorum irritas pronuntiant,
non apud Romanos tantum, sed et apud Graecos, ut notatum
ss'ggfifffiv· Dioni Chrysostomo oratione LXXV. adversus quasdam restitu-
tionis beneficium introducunt: sed hi effectus sunt proprii
legis civilis, ac proinde cum jure naturae ac gentium nihil
habent commune; nisi quod quibus locis obtinent, ibi eas
servari etiam naturale est. Quare etiamsi peregrinus cum
cive paciscatur, tenebitur illis legibus: quia qui in loco
aliquo contrahit, tanquam subditus temporarius legibus loci
subjicitur.
3 Plane aliud erit si in mari pactio fiat, aut in vacua
insula, aut per litteras inter absentes. Talia enim pacta jure
solo naturae reguntur, ut et pacta eorum qui summam habent

men, and idiots, and children, cannot make a promise. With
regard to minors, the case is different3 for although these are con-
ceived not to have a sufficiently stable judgment, as also women
are not, yet this state is not perpetual, nor is it of itself sufficient
to nullify the force of a promise.

2 When a boy begins to have the use of his reason, cannot be
defined with certainty: but the infel-enee is to be made from his
daily acts, or from that which commonly happens in each country.
So among the Hebrews, a promise was valid which was made by a
boy after he was thirteen years old, or a girl after twelve. Else-
where, the Civil Laws, moved by good reasons, pronounce certain
promises of wards or minoi-s to be void, not only among the Romans,
but also among the Greeks, as Dio Chrysostom notes3 and against
some such promises, they introduce the benefit of restitution. But
these are properly effects of Civil LaW, and therefore have nothing
to do with Natural Law and jus [sentinam except that when they ob·
min, it is agreeable to Natural Law that they be observed.

Hence even if a stranger make an agreement with a citizen, he
is bound by the same laws: because he who makes a contract in any
place, is under the laws of the place as a temporary subject*.

3 It is plainly another matter if the compact be made at sea,
