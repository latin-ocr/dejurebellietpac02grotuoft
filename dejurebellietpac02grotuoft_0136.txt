revocet nemini facit injuriam. Peccat tamen si sine justa
causa id faciat. At ex promissis et contractibus jus nascitur.
Contractibus ligantur contrahentes tantum, legibus subditi
omnes. Possunt tamen quaedam esse mixta et contractibus et
legibus, ut contractus cum vicino rege, aut cum publicano
factus, qui simul pro lege publicatur, quatenus ei insunt quae
subditis observanda sunt.

X. bVeniamus ad successores: de quibus adhibenda dis-
tinctio est, sintne omnium simul bonorum heredes, ut qui reg-
num, quod in patrimonio est, testamento, vel ab intestato ac-
cipiunt; an successores regni duntaxat, puta ex electione nova,
aut ex praescripto ; sive imitatione quadam vulgaris hereditatis,
sive aliter: an vero mixto jure succedentes, Nam qui bonorum
omnium ita ut regni heredes sunt, quin promissis et contracti-
bus teneantur dubitandum non est. Pro debitis enim etiam
personalibus bona defuncti ut obligata sint, ipsi rerum dominio
coaevum est. '

vokes them, he does wrong to no one. (He sins, however, if he do so
without just cause.) But from his promises and contracts, rights
arise. By contracts, the contracting parties only are bound 3 to laws,
all are subject. But yet some transactions may be mixed of contracte
and laws, as a treaty made with a neighbouring king, or with a farmer
of the revenues, which is at the same time published as a Law, so far
as it contains things to be observed by the subjects.

X. Let us proceed to the case of Successors: and with regard to
them, we must make a distinction, whether they are heirs to the whole
property of the deceased as well as to the kingdom3 as those are who
receive a patrimonial kingdom by testament, or by intestacy} or
whether they are only suecessors to the kingdom 3 suppose by a new
electiori, or by the law of the land, or by some imitation of the com-
mon rule of inheritanee‚ or otherwise: or whether, finally, they succeed
by mixed right. For with regard to those who are heirs of all the pro-
