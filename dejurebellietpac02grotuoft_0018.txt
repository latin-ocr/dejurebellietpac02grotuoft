VIII. 1 Neque refert quomodo gubernetur, regione, an
plurium, an multitudinis imperio. Idem enim est populus Ro-
manus sub regibus, consulibus, Imperatoribus. Imo etiamsi
plenissimo jure regnetur, populus idem erit qui antea erat
cum sui esset juriS, dum rex ei praesit, ut caput istius populi,
non ut caput alterius populi. Nam imperium quod in rege

council of the allies.

VIII. 1 Nor does it make any difference how the people is go-
verned, whether by the authority of a king, or that of a number, or
that of the multitude. The Roman people was the same under kings‚
consuls, emperors. Even if the king govern with the most absolute
power, the people will be the same which it was before, when it was its
own master3 provided the king is set over it as the head of that people,
not as the head of another people. For the authority which is in the
king· as the head, is in the people as the whole body, of which the head
is a part: and therefore when the king, if he be elective, or the king’s
family, is extinct, the supreme authority reverts to the people, as we
have shewn above.

Nor is the objection from Aristotle valid3 when he says that the
