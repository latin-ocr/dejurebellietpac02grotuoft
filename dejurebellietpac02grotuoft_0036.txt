bus regna restituit, adjecit et fructus medii temporis.

VI. Quarto, non teneri eum ad restituendos fructus quos
percipere neglexit: quia nec rem habet, nec quicquam quod
rei loco succedit.

VH, Quinto, si talis possessor rem sibi donatam alii
donaverit, non teneri cum nisi omnino etiam sine hac re do-
naturus tantundem fuisset: tunc enim lucrum erit rei suae

pepercisse.

held to be richer. And accordingly Caligula is praised for having,
in the beginning of his reign, when he restored governments to per-
sons, given them also the income of the interval elapsed.

VI. Fourtffly, a bona fide possessor is not bound to restore the
produce which he neglected to take 3 for he neither has the thing,
nor anything which has come into its place.

VII. Fifthly, if a bona fide possessor has given to another a thing*
given to himself, he is not bound to restitution, except, in any case,
without having this thing, he would have given something of equal
value: for then he has gained by sparing his own property.

VIII. Sixthly, if he sell a thing which he have bought (belonging
to another), he is not bound *, except in so far as he sold it for more
than he gave for it. If he have sold a thing given to him (belonging
to another) he is held to restore the priee3 except it happen that he
have spent the price, and would not otherwise have spent the money.

³² These two Rules do not agree well together: according to the seventh, a
thing belonging to another, which we have bought bonafide, we must restore to the
owner, not requiring the price from him ; according to the sixth, if we have bought
it, and then sold it, we are not bound to restore the price. It appears to be
assumed, in the seventh Rule, that we have a remedy against the seller. W.
