2 Again3 a person may be said to be civilly obliged by his own
act, either in this semes-that the obligation does not proceed from
mere Natural LaW, but from the Civil Law, or from both 3—01· in
this sense, that it gives ground for an action in a Court of LaW.

We say then that by the promise and contract of a king, which ho
enters into with his subjects, there arises a true and proper obligation,
which confers a right upon the subjects: for this is the nature of
promises and contracts, as we have shewn above, even between God
and men. But if the acts be such as arc done by the king, but done
by him, only as by any other man, the Civil Laws also will be valid in
that case: but if the act be an act of the king as king, the Oivil Laws
do not apply to that3 which distinction has not been sufficiently
attended to by Vasquius. But notwithstanding this distinction, in
either case a legal action will arise from the act3 namely, to the end
that the right of the creditor may be declared: but coaction cannot
sellom on account of the condition of those with whom the business
is. For it is not allowable for subjects to compe] him whose subjects
they are: equals have such a right towards equals, by natur03 supc-
riors have it over sileects by law only.

VII. This also is to be noted, that a right, even when it has
been acquired by subjects, may be taken away by the king in two
modes3 either as a Penalty, or by the force of Eminent Dominjon.
