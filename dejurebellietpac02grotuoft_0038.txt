natura indulgeat. Et quod alibi idem ait, si quis negotia mea

res meas aliquid impenderit, non quidem in id quod dedit, sed

recuperant ab aliis, quorum res jactu servatae sunt: quia et
qui rem alioqui perituram servavit, in hoc videtur locu-
pletior.

X. Octavo, eum, qui rem alienam emit, non posse eam
restituere venditori ut pretium servet, quia ex quo res in ejus
fuit potestate, jam, ut diximus, coepit obligatio restituendi.

XI. Nono, eum qui rem habeat, cujus dominus igno-

because, as soon as the thing is in his possession, the obligation of
restoring it has begun.

XI. Ninthly ; he who has a thing the owner of which is unknown,
is not naturally bound to give it to the poor: although this is a very
pious course, in many places properly ordered. The reason is, bc-
