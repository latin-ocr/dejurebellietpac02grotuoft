CAP. XIL] DE CONTRACTIBUS. 55

aut meri, aut cum mutua quadam obligatione. Benefici meri,
autin praesens absolvuntur, aut in futurum prominent. In
praesens absolvitur factum utile, do quo nihil loqui necesse est,
quando utilitatem quidem parit, sed nullum juris effectum:
item donatio, qua dominium transfertur, qua de re egimus
supra cum de dominii acquisitionibus ageretur. In futurum
prominent promissiones tum dandi, tum faciendi, de quibus
jamjam egimus. Benefici actus cum obligatione mutua sunt,
qui aut de re disponunt sine alienatione, aut de facto ita ut
aliquis effectus supersit. Talis est circa rem usus concessio,
qui commodatio dicitur: in factis praestatio operae sumtuosae,
aut obligatorize, quae dicitur mandatum, cujus species est de-
positum, praestatio scilicet operae in re custodienda. His
autem actibus similes sunt actuum promissiones, nisi quod, ut
diximus, hae in futurum prominent: quod et de actibus jam
explicandis intellectum volumus.

II. Of simple acts, some are gratuitously beneficial, others are of the
nature of exchange of one act for another, periimtatorial. Beneficial
acts are either merely so, or with some mutual obligation. Mere bene-
ficial acts are either discharged in the present time, 01· stand over for
the future. A useful good office is performed in the present time, and
of this it is not necessary to speak, since it produces advantage indeed
by the recipient, but no effect as of right: so also a donation, by which
ownership is transferred, of which we treated above, when wc spoke of
acquisitions of ownership. As acts standing over for the future, we
reckon promises both of giving and of doing3 concerning which we have
already spoken.

Beneficial acts with a mutual obligation, are those which dispose
of any thing without alienation, or so dispose of an act that some effect
survives. Such is a concession of the use of a thing, which is called a
Loan3 and of acts, the undertaking of an office cxpensive 01· obligatory,
which wc may call a Commission 3 of which kind is a Deposit, namely,
the office of keeping a thing in custody. Similar to these acts are the
promises of acts, except that, as we have said, these stand over for the
future3 which also we desire to have understood of thc acts now to be
explained.

III. 1 Pei-mutatorial acts either separate the parties or produce a
community between them. Thosc acts which separate, diremtorial
