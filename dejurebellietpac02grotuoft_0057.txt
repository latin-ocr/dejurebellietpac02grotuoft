CAP. ΧΙ.] DE PROMISSIS. 45

litas sit in contractu, haec quomodo sint resarcienda alia est
quaestio, mde qua mox videbimus.

X. Quod vero promittitur ob causam ante debitam, non
eo minus debetur, si jus naturale spectemuS, secundum ea quae
de rei alienae acceptione supra diximus: nam et sine ulla
causa promissum naturaliter deberetur. Sed hic quoque
damnum per extorsionem datum, aut inaequalitas in contractu
reparanda venient, secundum tradendas inferius leges..

XI. Modum promittendi quod attinet, is, ut de dominii
translatione diximus, requirit actum externum, id est signum
sufficiens voluntatis, quale interdum esse potest nutus, frequen-
tius autem vox aut literae.

XII. Sed et per hominem alterum ssobligamur, si constet.
de voluntate nostra qua illum elegerimus, nut instrumentum
nostrum ad hoc speciatim, aut sub generali notione. Et in
generali praepositione accidere potest, ut nos obliget qui prae-
positus est, agendo contra voluntatem nostram sibi soli signifi-
catam: quia hic distincti sunt actus volendi: unus quo nos
obligamus ratum habituros quicquid ille in tali negotiorum

there be an inequality in the contract‚ how these things are to bo
remedied, is another question, hereafter to be considered.

X. What is promised, for a consideration which was due without
the promise, is still to be paid, if we look at Natural LaW, according
to what we have said above of the acceptance of a thing belonging to
another. (11. x. 11 and 12.) But here also the damage produced
by extortion, or theLinequality of the contract, will require to be re-
paired, according to rules hei-caster to be given.

XI. As to what concerns the mode of making the promise, that,
as we said of the transfer of ownership, requires an external act; that
is, a sufficient sign of the will, which sometimes may be a nod, but
more frequently, the voice or writing.

XII. We may also be bound by means of another man, if there
be clear evidence of our purpose in appointing him as our instrument
either for this special purpose, or in a general manner. And in a
general appointment, it may happen that the person appointed binds
us, when he acts contrary to our will signified to him alone. For here
there are two distinct acts of willing: ono by which we obliged our-
solves to hold valid whatever hc does in this kind of business3 another,
