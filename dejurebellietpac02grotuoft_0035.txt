triae fructus etiam si sine re non procederent, rei tamen non

dominus est rei, idem naturaliter dominus est fructuum rei.

to be admitted to the money raised by the sale: and ho who has
lent money to support the son, if the father be insolvent, and the son

111. In the first place, it appears that a bona ficlc possessor is not
bound to any restitution, if the thing be destroyed3 for he neither
has the thing nor any gain from the thing: [a mala fide possessor is
bound by his own act, besides the consequences of wrong doing]

IV. Secondly, a bona fide possessor is bound to restore also the
still extant produce of the thing: I say the produce of the mitiss,-
for tho produco of industry, even if it would not take place without

both of the thing and of the produco of it consumod by him, if in
any case he would have consumcd as much: for by so much he is
