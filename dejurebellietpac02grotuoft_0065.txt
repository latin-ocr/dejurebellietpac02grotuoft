CAP. XL] DE PROMISSIS. 53

cum naturali jure confundantur, neque promissiones quae cau-
sam expressam non habent, naturaliter esse irritas, non magis
quam rerum donationes.

XXII. Neque eum qui factum alienum promisit ad id
quod interest teneri, modo facere non omiserit quod ex sua (ᾧζζζῇᾗζῗρ,
parte ad id factum obtinendum facere poterat3 nisi verba aut §⁵⁰
negotii natura obligationem inducant strictiorem. Velut per-
soluta fide, inquit Livius, ἰ(ῃιὶα per eum non stetisset quin

praestaretur.

c, xxi. §30.

 

XXII. Also that ho who has promised an act on the part of
another, is not bound to the extent of the interest of the promisee,
provided he has not omitted to do what he could on his own part,
to obtain the doing of the thing promised3 except thero be words,
or the nature of the business, such as to induce a stricter obligation.
As if he had performed his englam-(semem, says Livy, because it did not
clepend οη him that it was not performed.
