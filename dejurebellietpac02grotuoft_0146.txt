Ἄδραστον· οὗτος κῦριος τύραννος ὧν

minor pars populi: quod pro Romanis est adversus Gallos
Senonas: 3nam major pars populi erat apud Dictatorem Ca-
millum; bifariam autem, ut apud Gellium est, cum populo agi
non potest.

3 Sed ubi qui jus populi non habent, de eo quod populi
est spoponderunt, videamus in quid teneantur. Putet forte
aliquis hoc casu sponsores fidem liberasse, si operam omnem
dedissent, ut id quod spoponderunt fieret, secundum ea quae
de promisso tertii facto csupra diximus: sed negotii hujus, cui

says, The senate, as was to be expected, deoreed that ‘no Treaty
(foedus) could be made without its direction (md that of the people.

Hieronymus, king of Syracuse, made a Convention of alliance with ⁷

Annibal; but afterwards sent to Carthago to convert the Convention
into a Treaty. So that when Seneca says, The Treaty made by the
General zoas held made by tlzc People, he must mean the generals of the
old time, who had such a commission. In kingdoms, it is the king's
office to make Treatics. See Euripides.

2 As a Magistrate’s acts do not biud the People, so neither do
those of the smaller part of tho people: which justifies the Romans in
breaking their convention with the Galli Senones3 for the greater
part of the people was with the Dictator Camillus; and as Gellius
