116 DE EORUM QUI SUMMUM IMPERIUM [Lm. 11.

sit hoc quidem sensu eorum sententia, qui negant regem
teneri unquam his quae sine causa promisit: quod tamen quo
sensu locum habere possit mox videbimus.

rege, sed ab eo quasi alio quovis fieri solent. In quo actuum
genere tantum abest ut communes regni leges vim nullam ha-
beant, ut etiam leges oppidi, ubi Rex habitat, valere credamus3
quia speciali ratione rex ibi se habet, ut illius coetus membrum.
Quae tamen ut diximus ita procedunt, nisi circumstantiae osten-

promissione quolibet modo facta, bene convenit, et ex his, quae
supra diximus, explicari potest.

kings, no less than to others: so that we condemn, in this sense, the
opinion of those who say that a king is never bound by the promises
which he made without a cause. In what sense this may be truly
held, we shall hereafter see.

V. What we have said above, that the Civil Law of the kingdom
does not hold in the compacts and conti-acts of kings, Vasquius also
has rightly seen. But his inferences, that buying and selling with-

out a certain price, letting and hiring without stating the hire, a lease “

without a writing, are valid if done on the part of kings, is not to
be conceded: because these acts are not done by the king as king,
but by him as by any other person. In this class os acts, it is so far
from being true, that the common laws of the kingdom have no force,
that we maintain that even the laws of the town in which the king
lives are of force: inasmuch as the king abides there in a special
manner, as a member ef that society. Which, however, is as we say,
except circumstances shew that it pleases the king to make his act
free from the authority of those laws. Another example which Vas-
quius gives, of a promise made in any way, agrees well with this rule,
and may be explained by what we have said above.
