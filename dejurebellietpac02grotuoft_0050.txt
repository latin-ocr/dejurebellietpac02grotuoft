data, ex legis materia, verbis, et circumstantiis colligendum.
Similiter ergo dicemus, hsi promissio fundata sit in praesum-
tione quadam facti quod non ita se habeat, naturaliter nullam
ejus esse vim: quia omnino promissor nen consensit in pro-
missum, nisi sub quadam conditione quae re ipsa non extitit:
quo referenda est illa quaestio apud Ciceronem de Oratore
primo de eo, qui filium suum mortuum falso credens alium
instituerat heredem.

3 Quod si promissor negligens fuit in re exploranda,
aut in sensu suo exprimendo, ⁵et damnum inde alter passus
sit, tenebitur id resarcire promissor, non ex vi promissionis,
sed ex damno per culpam date, de quo capite infra agemus.
Si vero adfuerit quidem error, sed in quo fundata non fuerit
promissio, ratus erit actus, utpote non deficiente vero con-
sensu: sed hoc quoque casu si is cui promittitur dolo errori
causam dederit, quiequid ex eo errore damni promissor
fecit, resarcire tenebitur, ex alio illo obligationis capite. Si

tion of the law is wanting. But when the law is founded on such a
presumption, is to be collected from the matter, words, and eircum-
stances of the law, In like manner then we shall say, that when a
promise is founded on the presumption of some fact which is not really
so, that by Natural Law it has no force: because the Promiser does
not agree to the promise except on a certain condition which in reality
did not exist: to which we must refer Cicero's question eoncerning
the person who, falsely believing his son to be dead, made another
person his heir.

3 But if the promiser has been negligent in inquiring into the
matter, or in expressing his intention, and another person has thereby
suffered loss, the promiser will be bound to make that loss good3 not
by the force of his promise, but as having done damage by his fault3
of which head we shall hereafter treat. But if there was indeed an
error, but one on which the promise was not founded, the act will be
valid, a true consent being there not wanting. But in this case also,
if he to whom the promise is made, fraudulently give occasion to the
error, he will be bound to make good whatever damage the promiser
has done from that error, from that other head of obligation. If the
