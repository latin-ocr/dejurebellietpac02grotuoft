sine acceptione non possit intelligi. Nam actus donationis
perfectionem non habet nisi ex duorum consensu. At dedere,

de quo hic agimus, nihil est aliud quam civem alterius populi
potestati permittere, ita ut de eo statuat quod voluerit. Haec

autem permissio jus nullum dat aut adimit3 executionis tan-

tum impedimentum tollit. Quare si alter populus concesso

jure non utatur, erit is qui deditus est eo loco ut a suo populo

possit puniri (quod in Clodio Corsis dedito, nec ab iis accepto ζῶ. Max· vi-
evenit) aut non puniri, ut multa sunt delicta in quibus utrum- ⁶ ’ ⁴
vis fieri potest. Jus autem civitatis, utet jura et bona alia,

non amittitur ipso facto, sed decreto aliquo aut judicio, nisi

lex aliqua factum velit haberi pro re judicata, quod hic dici

non potest. Hoc denique modo et bona, si dedita nec accepta

sint, manebunt cujus fuerant. At si deditio accepta sit, et

postea casu aliquo reversus sit is qui fuerat deditus, is civis

non erit nisi ex novo beneficio: quo sensu verum est, quod
Modestinus de dedito respondit. L· 4· D· <1⁶

acceptancc. For the act of donation is not complete without the con-
sent of two: but tho giving up or surrender of which we have spoken
is nothing more than leaving a citizen of ours to the power of another
people, so that they may determine about him what they will. But
this permission does not give or take away any right: it may take
away an impediment to the execution of punishment. Therefore if
the other people do not use the right which is conceded to it, the
person so surrendered will 'oe in a condition to bc punished by his own
nation, (as happened in the case of Clodius, surrendered to the Cor-
sicans and not accepted by them3) or he may not be punished, as there
are many delicts in which the one or the other may take place. And
the rights of a citizen, like many other rights and posscssions‚ arc not
lost by a mere fact, bnt by some decree or sentence3 except there bc
some law which directs the fact to be considered as a judicial act, ⁸
which cannot be said in this case. And in the same way, if goods aro
surrendered but not accepted, they remain whose they were. But if
the surrendcr of a person is accepted, and afterwards he who had
been surrendered happens to return, he is no longer a citizen, except
by some new concession of citizenship to him: and in this sense the

opinion which Modestinus gave respecting a person surrendered, is
true.
