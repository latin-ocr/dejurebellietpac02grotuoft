Add to this, that when the will is sufficiently signified, the owner-
ship of a thing may be transferred, as we have already said ε why then
may there not also be a transfer of a jus in personam, a right to the
performance of a person's promise, or a right to transfer ownership
(which is a less thing than ownership itself,) or a right to do anything;
since we have the same right over our actions as over the things
which belong to us?

4 To this is to be added the consent of wisc men3 for as it is said
by jux-ism, that nothing is so natural as that the will of the owner
when he wishes to transfer to another a thing which is his, should be
held valid3 in the same way it is said that nothing is so congruous to
the mutual confidence of mankind, as to perform the agreements which
have been made among men. Thus tho edict concerning paying
money agreed to be paid at a certain time, when in the person so
agreeing no causo had preceded except consent, is said to favour natu-
ral equity. Paulus also says, that a man owes us a debt, when, jure
, qondam, he ought to give it us, we relying upon his good faith3 in which
place, first, the word ozfflet implies a certain moral necessity: nor can
we admit what Connanus says, that we rely upon a man's good faith,
only when some step has been taken in agreement with the promise:
for in that place Paulus was speaking of an aetion for recovering what
has been paid and was not owing: which falls to the ground, if tho
