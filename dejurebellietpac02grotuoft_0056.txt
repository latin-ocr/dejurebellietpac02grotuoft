IX. Quaeri hic solet, an promissio facta ob causam natu-
raliter vitiosam ipsa natura valeat, ut si quid promittatur
homicidii perpetrandi causa. Hic ipsam promissionem vitio-
sam esse satis apparet: in hoc enim adhibetur, ut alter impel-
latur ad malum facinus, Sed non quicquid vitiose fit effectu
juris caret, quod in prodiga donatione apparet. Hoc interest,
quod donatione facta jam cessat vitiositas: nam sine vitio res
relinquitur apud donatarium. At in promissis ob causam
vitiosam manet vitium, quamdiu non perpetratum est crimen:
tamdiu enim impletio ipsa promissi, ut mali illex, labem in se
habet, quae cessare incipit peracto crimine. Unde sequitur
usque ad id tempus promissionis talis efficaciam esse in pen-
denti, ut modo dicebamus in promissa re quae juris nostri non
est: crimine vero perpetrato, jam obligationis vim exseri,
quae ab initio non intrinsecus defuit, sed ab accedente vitio
fuit impedita. Ex hujus rei exemplum afferri potest in Juda
Jacobi filio, qui Thamari, quam meretricem putabat, pro-
missam mercedem, ¹tanquam debitam, persolvit. Quod si
injustitia promissarii causam promissioni dederit, aut inaequa-

IX. It is commonly made a question, whether a promise made
for a cause naturally vicious is valid by Natural Law3 as if any thing
be promised for conimitting homicide. Here it is evident enough
that the promise itself is vicious, for it is made that another person
may be induced to commit a crime. But what is done vieiously, is
not necessarily void, as to its jural effects3 as appears by the case of a
prodigal donation. There is however this difference; that when the
donation is made, the viciousness ceases: for there is no vice in the
thing being left in the hands of the donatary. But in promises made
for a vicious cause, the vice remains as long as the crime is not per-
petrated: so long, the fulfilment of the promise, as a stimulus to
evil, has a taint in it which ceases when the crime is committed.
XVhenoe it follows, that up to that time, the efficacy of such a promise
is suspended, as we said above, in speaking of promising a thing which
is not ours to give: but the crime being perpetrated, the force of the
obligation comes into play, having been intrinsically in existence from
the first, but barrcd by the vice which was connected with it. We
have an example of this in Judah, who paid to Thamar her hire,
deeming her a hai-lot.
