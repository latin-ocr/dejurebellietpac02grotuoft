ΟΑΡ. ΧΧΙΙῙ.] DE CAUSIS DUBIIS. 411

careat, praesertim ubi pars utraque, aut altera litigat non suo

sed alieno nomine, puta ex tutoris officio, cui congruit jus

etiam incertum non deserere. Sic Aristotcles in litibus juris iii.mzec.17.
controversi, ait neutrum esse improbum, quod ipse dicit πο-
νηρόν. Cui consentiens Quintilianus posse accidere ait, ut ex mm, 17,
utraque parte orator, id est, vir bonus, dicat. Imo et juste
judicare judicem ambigue dici ait Aristoteles, significari enim T0p.i.13.
aut judicare ὠς δεῖ, plane ut oportet, sine ulla ignorantia,

aut κατὰ τήν ἑαυτοῦ «γνώμην, ex animi sui sententia. Et

alibi ait: εἱ οἷ’γνοῶν ἔκρινεν, οὐκ ἀδικεῖ, Si quis per ifflw- Nic. v. 12,
rantz'am judicaverit, non eyit injuste.

4 At in bello vix est, ut temeritas saltem omnis et dilec-
tionis defectus absit, ob negotii ipsius gravitatem, quae omnino
talis est, ut causis probabilibus non contenta, quam maxime
evidentes requirat.

5 At justum si accipimus, quoad effectus quosdam juris,
certum est, bellum hoc sensu justum utrimque dari, ut ex iis
apparebit, quae de bello publico solenni infra a nobis dicentur.

Sic enim et sententia non ex jure lata et possessio sine jure
habent quosdam juris effectus.

least one, litigates not on his own account, but on that of another3 as
for instance, in consequence of the office os· guardian or trustee, whose
business it is not to desert a right which is only doubtful. So Aris-
totlc says that in a doubtful question of laW, neither side is bad3 and
Quintilian, that there are cases in which a good man may speak as an
advocate on either side. Aristotlc says too, that there are two senses in
which we may say the judge judges right1y3 the one, in which ho
judges as hc ought according to the case, not making allowance for
ignoranc03 tho other, in which he judges sincerely as he thinks. To
do this, as he says in another place, is not to judge unjustly.

4 But in war it cannot easily happen that there is not, on ono side,
at least temerity and a lack of charity‚ the matter being so grave, that
we ought not to be content with probabilitics, but should requiro evi-
dent causes,

5 If we take just as to some legal effccts, it is certain that in
this sense a war may be just on both sides; as will appear by what
we shall have to say hereaftcr of a penul public war. So a sentence of
a judgc, though given not according to law, and possession without right,
have certain legal effects.
