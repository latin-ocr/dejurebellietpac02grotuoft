428 MONITA DE NON TEMERE ETIAM EX [Lm. ΙΙ.

tam massua, tam horrenda, tam sceva quisquis cum dolore
considerat, miseriam necesse est fateatur: quisquis autem
vel patitur ea sine animi dolore, vel coqitat, multo utique
miserius ideo se putat beatum, quod et humanum perdidit
sensum. Idem alio loco: belliqerare malis videtur felicitas,
bonis necessitas. Maximus autem Tyrius: τῆς τοῦ πολε-
μεῖν χρείας κᾷν ἀφέλῃς ‘td ἄδικον, ἐλεεινὸν αὐτῆς τό
ἀναγκαῖον· de bello etiamsi demas injustitiam, ipsa per se
necessitas miseranda est. Idem: φαίνεται ὁ πόλεμος τοῖς
μὲν δικαίοις α’ναΎκαῖος ὢν, τοῖς δὲ ἀδίκοις ἑκούσιος· ap-
paret bellum a justis non sumi nisi necessario, ab injustis
sponte.

2 Cui Senecae illud addendum, non esse homini homine
prodige utendum. Philiscus Alexandrum monebat, ut gloriae
quidem studeret, sed ea lege, ne se pestilentiam aut magnum

Οὐκ ἐπιτρέπει δὲ πολλοὺς πολέμους
ἠγωνισμένῳ καὶ φόνῳ τῶν ἐχθρῶν με·
μιασμένῳ· non permisit templum struere
ei qui multa bella bellasset, pollutusque
esset, hostili quidem, attamen sanquine.
Verba sunt Josephi libro vn. cap. 4.

equidem in qlorz'a posuerim tantam etiam
coactam humani qeneris injuriam. Phi-
lo de Vita Mosz’s: καὶ ’γάρ εἰ νόμιμοι
αἱ κατ’ ἐχθρῶν σφαγαὶ, ἀλλ’ ὅγε κτεί-
νων ἅνθρωπον, εἰ καὶ δικαίως καὶ α’μυ-
νόμενος καὶ βιασθεὶς, ὑπαίτιος εἶναι

this very way, there would be no wars. The iniquity of men may
make wars just, and even necessary3 but this iniquity is a thing to
be lamented, even if it did not lead to war. Whoever considers the
evils of war, must confess the miseries of the case3 who suffers it
without grief, is more miserable in his joy, because he has lost the
sense of humanity. And in another place, The bad think war a
pleasure, the qood, a necessity. So Maximus Tyrius.

2 To which we must add what Seneca says, that man is not to
use man prodigally. Philiscus admonished Alexander, that he might
consult his glory, but on condition that he did not make himself a
pestilence or a plague: meaning that he must not bring about the
destruction of populations and the desolation of cities, such as a
pestilence produces: while nothing more becomes a king, than to
provide for the safety of all, as peace does provide.

3 When we consider that by the Hehrew law he who had slain
a man, even without intending it, was obliged to fly3 that God for-
bade his temple to be built by David, who is related to have carried
on pious wars, because he had shed much blood3 that even among
the ancient Greeks, those who had stained their hands with man-
