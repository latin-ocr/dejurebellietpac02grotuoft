CAP. X.] EX DOMINIO ORITUR. 21

Latro spolia quae milti abstulit, posuit apud Seium inscium
de malitia deponentis: utrum latroni, an milli restituere
Seius debeat ,ρ Si per se dantem, accipientemque, intuemur,
Izaec est bona fides, ut commissam rem recipiat is qui dedit :
Si totius rei (equitatem, quoe ex omnibus personis, quae neqo-
tio isto continquntur, impletur, mihi reddenda sunt, quoi
(male legitur quo) facto scelestissimo ademta sunt. Recte
autem addit ε Et probo Itane esse justitiam, quoe suum cuique
ita tribuit, ut non distrahatur ab ullius personae justiore
repetitione. J ustior nimirum est repetitio domini ex jure illo,
quod ipsi dominio aequaevum diximus: unde etiam illud se-
quitur quod apud eundem Tryphoninum est, ut qui rem suam
ignorans depositam accepit, reddere eam non teneatur: et
quod ibidem paulo ante quaerebatur de bonis depositis ab eo,
cujus bona erant publicata, hinc potius quam ex eo quod de
poenarum utilitate adfert Tryphoninus‚ definiendum est.

5 Nam ad dominii naturam nihil refert, ex gentium, an
ex civili jure oriatur: semper enim secum habet quae sibi

property and deposited it in tlte hands of Seius, who was iynorant of the
'crimes ouqht Seius to restore it to tlte robber or to me? Is we look only
at tlte yiver and receiver, bona fides requires that tlte thing] deposited
should be restored to him who qave it. If we look at the equity of tlce
whole matter, taking] into account all the persons concerned, the property
must be restored to nze, from whom it was most wronqsnlly taken. And
he rightly adds: Ι am os opinion tlzat justice requires to θῖνα to each man
his own in such. a way, that it be not aqain to be transferred by tlte more
just demand of another person. In fact, the claim of the owner is more
just, in virtue of that right which we have spoken of as contemporary
with ownership. And hence it follows, as we find in the same Try-
phoninus, that he who in ignorance has received, as a deposit, a thing
which is his own, is not bound to restore it: and the question dis-
eussed a little before, concerning things deposited by him whose pro-
perty had been forfeited, is to be deeided on these grounds, rather
than by the consideration which Tryphoninus adduces, of the utility
of the punishment.

5 It makes no difference in the nature of ownership whether it
arise jure yentium or jure civili.- for it always has along with it tho
accompaniments which are natural to it: among which is the obliga-
tion of every possessor to restore a thing to its owner. And this is
