CAP. XII.] DE CONTRAOTIBUS. 63

injuste ‘¹incutiatur contrahendi eausa, aut si incussus est, ut
dematur. Hoc spectantes Lacedaemonii resciderunt emtionem
agri, quam Elei possessoribus metu expresseram, ’γνόντες
μηδὲν δικαιότερον εἶναι, βίᾳ πριαμένους ἢ βίᾳ ἀφελομένους,
παρὰ τῶν ἡττόνων λαμβάνειν· Arhia-ati nihilo justius esse,
infirmioribus per emtionis titulum, quam vi mera rem extor-
quere, quae Xenophontis verba sunt. Quod tamen quam ex· ἔικὲιέρσωῆ.

ΧΙ. 1 In ipso actu principali haec desideratur aequalitas,
ne plus exigatur quam par est. Quod in contractibus bene-
ficis locum vix potest habere. Nam si quis pro commodato, 1²²S'· ‘²¹³

justly impressed with a view to the contract3 οι· if it be impressed,
that it be put away. Looking at this rule, the Laeedaemonians re-
scinded the purchase of the land which the Thebans had extorted
from the possessors by sear. See Xenophon. What exception there
is to this in the Law of Nations‚ we shall see in its own place.

XI. 1 In the principal aet of a eontraet this equality is required,
that more be not demanded than is equitable. Which, in beneficial
contracts, ean hardly have place. For if any one demands some
payment for a Ioan, or for executing a commission‚ or keeping a de-
posit, he does no wrong, but he alters the nature of the contract,
and makes it, from being gratuitous, become semipermutatory. But
in all permutatory conti-acts this is earefully to be observed. N or is
it enough for any one to say that what the other party has promised
more than equality, is to be regarded as a donation. For such is not
the intention of conti-acting parties, and is not to be presumed so,
except it appear. For what they promise or give, they are to be
supposed to promise or give as equivalent to what they are to receive,
and as what is done on the ground of such equivalenee.
