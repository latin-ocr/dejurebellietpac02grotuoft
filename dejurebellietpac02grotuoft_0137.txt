XI. 1 cAt qui in jus regni duntaxat succedunt3 aut
partim in bona, in jus regni vero in solidum3 quatenus obli-
gentur, tam dignum est quaeri, quam confuse hactenus tracta-
tum est. dDii-ecte, hoc est α’μέσως, hos successores regni,
qua tales, non obligari satis est manifestum: quia jus non
accipiunt ab eo qui proxime decessit, sed a popu10, sive ea
successio propius accedat ad jus hereditatum vulgarium, sive
absit longius: de quo discrimine supra egimus,

2 Sed ἐμμέσως, id est eper interpositam civitatem, obli-
gantur etiam tales successores: quod sic intelligetur. Coetus
quilibet, non minus quam personae singulares, jus habet se ob-
ligandi per se, aut per majorem sui partem. Hoc jus trans-
ferre potest tum expresse, tum per consequentiam necessariam,
puta imperium transferendo3 nam in moralibus qui dat finem,
dat ea quae ad finem perducunt.

XI. . 1 But of those who succeed only to the kingdom3 or to tho
property as sharers only, but to the kingdom, alone3 how far they are
bound, is a matter worthy of inquiry, especially as it has hitherto been
treated very confusedly. That the successors of the kingdom, as
such, are not directly and immediately bound [by those cont1·acts‚] is
evident enough3 because they receive their rights, not from him who
has lately deceased, but from the people3 whether the rule of suc-
cession approach more nearly to the rule of common inhmitance, or
recede further from it3 of which difference we have treated above.

2 But mediately, that is, by the mediate effect of the State, such
successors also are bound; which will be thus understood. Every
society, no less than individual persons, has the right of binding itself,
by its own act, or that of the majority. And this right it may trans-
fer, either expressly, or by necessary consequence; suppose, by trans-
ferring the government: for in moral matters, he who gives the end,
gives the means which lead to the end.

XII. 1 But this does not go to an infinito extent. For an infinite
power of imposing such obligations is not necessary, in order rightly
