126 DE EORUM QUI SUMMUM IMPERIUM [Lm. 11.

ant,'populi per se, aut per θος, qui populum legitime referunt,
consensus requiritur, ut ex iis quae de alienatione supra dixi-
mus intelligi potest. Quibus distinctionibus adhibitis facile J'u-
dieari poterit, justae an injustae fuerint exceptiones regum, qui
priorum regum nomina exsolvere recusarunt, quorum heredes
non fuerant: quarum exempla apud Bodinum videre est.

XIII. Illud quoque ⁰a multis traditum, beneficia Princi-
pum, quae liberaliter sunt concessa, semper posse revocari,
sine distinctione transmittendum non est. Sunt enim quaedam
beneficia quae rex de suo facit, et quae, nisi adsit precarii clau-
sula, vim habent perfectae donationis. PHaee revocari non
possunt, nisi quod subditos attinet in poenam, aut ob utilitatem
publicam cum compensatione si fieri potest. Sunt alia quae
vinculum duntaxat legis demunt sine ullo contractu. Et haec
sunt revocabilia. Quia sicut lex sublata universaliter reponi
universaliter semper potest, ita et particulariter sublata parti-
culariter reponi. Nullum enim hie jus quaesitum est adversus
legis auctorem.

which the people has excepted from the royal power. For in order
to give validity to such acts, there is required the consent of the
People, either by itself, or by those who legitimately represent the
People3 as may bc understood by what we have said above respect·-
ing alienation. By the application of these distinctions, it will be
easy to judge whether the pleas of kings who refuse to pay their
predecessors’ debts, not being their heirs, are just or unjust: of
which examples may be seen in Bodinus.

XIII. Nor is that which many have delivered, that the favours
of Princes, granted out of pure liberality, may at any time be rer
voked, to be allowed to pass on without distinction. For there are
some grants which the king makes out of his own property, and
which, except they are granted expressly during pleasure only, have
the force of a complete donation. And these cannot be revoked,
except, in the case of subjects, in the way of penalty, or for the sake
of public utility, and then with compensation if it may be. There
are other grants which merely remove legal restrictions without any
contraet. These are revocable. Because, as the law which is re-
laxed universally may always be re—established universally, so, that
which is relaxed particularly may be re-established particularly. For
in this case no right against the author of the law is acquired.
