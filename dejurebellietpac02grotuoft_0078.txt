64 DE CONTRACTIBus. [Lm. 11.

2 Joh. Chrysostomusz ὅταν *γάρ ἐν τοῖς συμβολαίοις
καὶ η’νῖκα d ἂν α”γοράσαι δέῃ τι ἢ καὶ ἀποδόσθαι, φιλονεικῶ-
μεν καὶ βιαζώμεθα ἔλαττον τῆς ἀξίας καταλαβεῖν καὶ πάντα
ὑπὲρ τούτου ποιῶμεν, οὐ λῃστεία τὸ πρᾶγμα ἐστίν· Quoties
enim in contractibus, et quoties emendum quid aut dependen-
dum est, contendimus, omnique modo laboramus ut minus
oequo pretio demus ; ⁵uonue lcuz‘cfacto quoddam inest furtum ‚9
Scriptor vitae Isidori apud Photium, Hermiam narrat, ubi
quod emere vellet justo forte minoris esset indicatum, adjecisse
quod justo pretio deerat, quod existimaret aliter agere injus-
titiae esse speciem, sed talis quze plurimos lateret. Et in hunc
sensum interpretantur Hebraei legem, quae est iLevit. xxv.
14 et 17.

XII. 1 Restat {equalitas in eo de quo agitur, in hoc
consistens, ut etiamsi nec celatum quicquam sit quod dictum
oportuit, nec plus exactum quam deberi putabatur, si in re
tamen deprehendatur inaequalitas, quamquam sine culpa par-
tium, puta quod vitium latebat, aut de pretio errabatur, ea
quoque sit resarcienda, et demendum ei qui plus habet, red-
dendumque minus habenti: quia in contractu id utrimque pro-
positum aut fuit, aut esse debuit, ut uterque tantundem ha-
berent.

2 Authorities of Chrysostom, Hermias, Levit. xxv, 14 and 17.

XII. 1 There remains to be considered, equality in the thing
itself, consisting in this, that though nothing was concealed which
ought to have been told, nor more exacted than was thought to be
due3 yet if there be an inequality in the thing itself, though without
any fault of the parties3 if for instance there was some latent defect,
or some error about the price, that also is to be made good, and the
difference paid to him who suffers by it; because, in a contremet, there
was intended, or ought to have been, that each party should have
the same value.

2 The Roman law appointed this as the rule, not in every ine-
quality, (for the law does not follow matters to their smallest dimen-
sions, and also wishes to obviate the multitude of lawsuits,) but in a
grave inequality, as for instance, one which exceeds the half of the
fair price. In fact, laws, as Cicero says, remove what is not equitable, in
cases when you can take hold of it with your hand3 the philosophers, so
