si dominii ea tantum fuisset vis ut poscenti domino reddenda
ros esset, nimis debile futurum fuisset dominium, et nimis
sumtuosa custodia.

duced, thero is a sort of association established among owners‚ that
he who has in his power a thing belonging to another, is to restore it
to the owner. For if ownership were only so far effective, that the
thing is to be restored to the owner if he asks for it, ownership would
be too feeble, and eustody too expensive.

3 Nor is it here considered whether a person has obtained pos-
session of the thing bona fide or mala fide, believing that he has a right,

tho thing (and possession of it) is another. The Lacedaemonians
tried to free themselves from the delict by condemning Phoebidas who
had seized Cadmea, the eitadel of the Thebans, in violation of the treaty3
but as they, nevertheless, retained the citadel, they were charged
with injustice: and this injustice, as being flagrant, was avenged by
a singular providence of God, as Xenophon notes. So Cicero
blames M. Crassus and Q. Hortensius who had kept possession of
legaeies by a will which was false, though fabricated without fault of
theirs.

4 But because this obligation binds all men, as by a universal
contram, and gives a certain right to the owner: hence it eomes that
special contracts, as later in time, are subject to exception. Hence
light is thrown on the case put by Tryphoninus. A robber took my
