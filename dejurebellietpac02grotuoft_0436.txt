a moral claim to two contrary things, to act and to prevent the action,
by the nature of the subject, cannot exist. But it may be that nei-
ther of the belligerent parties act unjustly: for no one acts unjustly
except he who knows that he is doing an unjust thing: and many
persons do not know this when it is so. Thus persons may carry
on a lawsuit justly, that is, bona fide on both sides. For many points
both of laW, and of the facts from which the law arise, escape the
notice of the parties concernod.

example in those who do not observe the law, being ignorant of it
without any fault of theiis, though it has been promulgated, and a
sufficent time sor their beeoming acquainted with it has elapsed. So
in litigation it may happen that both parties are free not only from
injustice, but from all other vices; especially when both parties, or at
