CAPae ΙΧ.] DOMINIA DESINANT. 9

est quod Aristotelem hic mihi quis objiciat, qui reipublicae

forma mutata negat eandem esse civitatem, sieut, inquit, har· Pol. iii. ³.

2 Sciendum enim est unius rei artificialis plures esse
posse species, sicut legionis species una est qua regitur, altera
qua militat. Ita civitatis species una. est, consociatio juris at-
que imperii3 altera, relatio partium inter se earum quae regunt,
et quae reguntur. Hanc spectat politicus, illam jurisconsultus:
quod nec Aristotelem latuit eum ita subjicit: an vero exsol-
venda sint nomina necne, mutata yubernandi forma, alia
inspectio est.- artis scilicet alterius, quam cum politica non
confundit Aristoteles, ne quod in aliis culpat admittat ipse,

3 Non desinit debere pecuniam populus, rege sibi impo-
sito, quam liber debebat: est enim idem populus et dominium
retinet eorum quae populi fuerant, imo et imperium in se reti-
net, quanquam jam non exercendum a corpore, sed a capite:

form of the State being changed, the State is no longer the same; as,
says he, the harmony is not the same when we modulate out of the
Dorian mood into the Phrygiam [though the notes may be the same).

2 For it is to be understood that an artificial thing may have seve-
ral forms ; thus, one form of a legion (or regiment) is its government by
lessati, tribuni, centuriones; (colonels, captainS‚ serJeants, &c.): another
form of the same body is its order of march or of battle. Thus one
form of a State is the common participation of right and authority;
and another is the relation of the parts governing and governed. The
politician looks at the latter form, the jux-ist at the former: and Aris·
totle was awai-e of this, when he subjoins, Whetlzer the name (of the
State) is to bc chanqed when the form qs qoem-nmen! is clzanyed, is another

does not confound with Political Science (Politian), that he may not
commit the fault which he blaines in others, of passing] to another

3 When a Pcople has a king placed ever it, it does not cease to
owe the moneys which it owed being free: for it is the same people‚
and retains the ownership of the things which had belonged to the
people3 and also authority over itself, though this authority is not
