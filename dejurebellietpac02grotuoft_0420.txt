39·AE DE CAUSIS INJUSTIS. [LIB.II.

contingit sine prophetico spiritu, ctiam rerum certarum latere
nos possunt tempora. Ac postremo praedictio, nisi expres-
sum adsit Dei mandatum, jus nullum dat, cum Deus, quae
praedixit, saepe per improbos homines aut pravas actiones ad
exitum ire permittat.

XVI. Illud quoque sciendum est, si quis quid debet,
non ex justitia propria, sed ex virtute alia, puta liberalitate,
gratia, misericordia, dilectione, id sicut in foro exigi non
potest, ita nec armis deposci. Nam ad utrumque horum non
sufficit, ut id, quod postulatur, sit ex morali ratione facien-
dum, sed praeterea opus est in nobis jus quoddam sit ad illud,
quale jus interdum leges divinae et humanae dant etiam circa
debita aliarum virtutum: quod cum fit, nova tunc debendi
ratio accedit, quae jam ad justitiam pertinet. Id cum deest,

[mmmm injustum ex hac causa bellum est, ut Romanorum in regem

ἓῖιῖξὲηέῑν. Cypri tanquam ingratum. Nam qui beneficium dedit, nullum

ΜΒΝ] habet jus ad reposcendam gratiam: alioqui contractus esset,
non beneficium.

even if the events are certain, we may be wrong as to the time. And
lastly, the prediction, except there be an absolute command of God,
gives no right, since the events which are predicted by God are often
brought to pass by wicked men or wieked actions.

XVI. This also must be observed3 that if any one has a claim

upon him, which is not a claim of justice, but of some other vir· γ

tue, as liberality, kindness, mercy, charity3 as this claim cannot be
prosocuted in a court of justice, so also it cannot be asserted by arms.
For neither the one nor the other of these can be resorted to, in
order that what is demanded may be done for a moral reason: it is
requisito besides, that there be in us some right to that very thing:
which right sometimes divine and human laws give with respect to
the claims which rest upon other virtues [than justice]; and when this
happens, then there is introduced a new reason of obligation, and the
matter belongs to justice. When that is wanting, the war is unjust
for that reason: as was, for instance, the war of the Romans against
the king of Cyprus, because he was ungrateful. For he who has
bestowed a benefit has no riylzt to require a return: if he had, it
would be a contract, not a benefit.
