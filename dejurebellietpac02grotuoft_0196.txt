‘178 DE INTERPRETATIONE. [nm. 11.

idem, sed per aliud {eque utile, aut utilius quam erat id quod
mandator praescripserat. ³Id enim ita demum licet, si constet
quod praescriptum erat, non praescriptum fuisse sub· speciali
sua forma, dsed sub consideratione generaliore, quae aliter
quoque obtineri possit: quomodo eum qui fide jubere erat jus-
sus, mandare posse creditori, ut tertio pecuniam numeret, a
Scaevola responsum est. Ceterum ubi de eo non satis constat,
retinendum est quod apud Gellium eo loco legitur, dissolvi
imperantis officium, siquis ad id, quod facere jussus est, non
obsequio debito, sed consilio non desiderato respondeat,

XXII. Restringens interpretatio extra significationem
verborum quai promissionem continent, aut ex defectu petitur
originario voluntatis, aut ex casus emergentis repugnantia
cum voluntate. Defectus voluntatis originarius intelligitur ex
absurdo, quod alioqui evidenter sequeretur; ex cessatione ra-
tionis equae sola plene et efficaciter movit voluntatem3 et ex
materiae defectu. Primum in eo fundamentum habet, quod
nemo credendus est velle absurda.

who gave the commission, For it is lawful to do so, if it be clear
that what was prescribed was not prescribed under its special form,
but under a more general purpose, which might also be obtained
in some other way: thus, he who was ordered to give security for a
loan to be made to a third person, might, instead, give an order to
the lender to make the payment to the third person3 as Seaevola
held. [Digy. XVII. 1.] But when that is not clear, we must hold, as
Crassus says, in Gellius in that place, that the demand of the superior
is disregarded, if any one, in place of discharging his commission as
directed, respond by advice which was never asked for.

XXII. An interpretation restricting a promise, extraneously to
the signification of the words which contain the promise, is derived
either from original limitation of the will [of the promiser]‚ or from
the repugnance with such will which comes to view in some occurring
case. A limitation of the original will is understood—from the ab-
surdity which would evidently follow, if it were not so limited 3—fr0m
the cessation of the reason which alone fully and efficaciously moved
the will 3—and from the defeat of the matter.

The first restriction has its ground in the consideration, that no
one is supposed to intend what is absurd.
