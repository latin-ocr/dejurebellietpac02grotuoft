amicorum rapuissent, desertaque patria mari vagarentur, ac
ne revocati quidem redirent, an rectores eo nomine tenerentur,
aut quod malorum hominum usi essent opera, aut quod cau-
tionem non exegissent. Dixi eos in nihil amplius teneri, quam
ut noxios, si reperiri possent, punirent aut dederent: praeterea
in bona raptorum jus reddi curarent. Nam ipsos injustae prae-
dationis causam non fuisse, nec quicquam de ea participasse3
prohibuisse etiam legibus nc amicis noceretur: cautionem ut
exigerent nullo jure fuisse obligatos, cum possent, etiam sine
codicillis, omnibus subditis hostem spoliandi potestatem facere,
quod et factum olim esset: neque talem permissionem causam
esse cur damnum datum esset sociis, cum possent privati etiam
sine permissu tali naves armare et in mare progredi. Mali
vero an futuri illi essent provideri non potuisse3 neque vero
vitari posse quo minus et malorum opera utamur, alioqui nul-
lum colligi posse exercitum.

contra imperium amicis nocuissent, reges teneri: quod kGalliae
et Angliae testimoniis probatum. Ut vero sine culpa sua ex
ministrorum facto quisquam teneatur, non esse juris gentium,

several persons letters of privateering and authority to make captures,
and some of these persons had captured the property of friends, and,
leaving their country, led a life of sea-rovers, not returning even when
summoned 110m03-Whethe1· the rulers were bound to restitution; either
as having used the agency of bad men, or as not having demanded cau-
tion-money. I gave my opinion, that they were bound to nothing more
than to punish and surrender the guilty persons, if they could be found3
and, besides, to make the goods of the plunderers liable: for that they
had not been the cause of the unlawful spoliation, nor had in any way
shared in it; and had forbidden by law the plunder of friends: that
there was no law obliging them to demand cantion-money, since they
might, if they chose, give all their subjects the right of capturing
enemy’s goods, which in former times had been done: and that such
permission was not the cause why friends had been damaged, since
private persons, even without such permission‚ could arm vessels and
go to sea. And that whether those who went would turn out good or
bad men, could not be foreseen3 nor was it avoidable to use the
agency of bad men as well as good, since otherwise no army could
be got together.

2 Nor, if either soldiers or sailors, contrary to command, do any
damage to friends, are the kings liable3 which has been proved by the
