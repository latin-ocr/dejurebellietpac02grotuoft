XI. 1 Praeterea notandum, interdum imponi alicui ali-

peccati alieni, sed non ita ut id peccatum causa sit proxima
ejus actionis, quod jus ipsum agendi attinet. Sic qui occa-

Lepidus should bear the same lot. And this, he says, was the ancient
custom, and common to all eities3 though this custom was much
limited and tempered by the later laws of Rome. So when by the
delict of the general body, which, as we have said, stands for the whole
body, the whole body is in fault, and on that ground loses, as we have
said, civil liberty, city walls, and other admutages, innocent indi-
viduals also feel the inconveniences3 but they feel it in those things
which only belonged to them through the general body.

XI. 1 It is further to be remarked, that sometimes a person has
harm imposed upon him, or loses good, by the occasion indeed of
another‘s fault, yet not so that the fault is the proximate cause of the
action, so far as pertains to the right of acting. Thus he who has
promised something on occasion of another's debt, suffers damage, as
the old proverb says, ›S'zcretyship is vemt door to miscMegss but the
proximate cause of the obligation is his promise. For as he who is
surety for a buycr, is not properly bound by the sale, but by his pro-
mise; so he who is bound for a delinquent, is not bound by the delict,
but by his own engagement. And hence the loss which he has to
bear is measured, not by the other's delict, but by the power which
he had in promising.

2 From which it follows, that according to the opinion which we
hold for the sounder‚ no body can be put to death in virtue of surety-
slnip3 because we hold that no one has such right over his own life,
