CAP. XL] DE PROMISSIS. 35

ΙΙΙ. Secundus gradus est, cum voluntas se ipsam pro
futuro tempore determinat, cum signo sufficiente ad indican-
dam perseverandi necessitatem. Et haec pollicitatio dici
potest, quae seposita lege civili obligat quidem, aut absolute,
aut sub conditione, sed jus proprium alteri non dat. Multis
enim casibus evenit, ut obligatio sit in nobis, et nullum
jus in alio: sicut in debito misericordiae et gratiae repo-
nendae apparet, quibus simile est hoc debitum constantiae sive
fidelitatis. Itaque ex tali pollicitatione res pollicitantis reti-
neri, aut is ipse qui pollicitus est ad implendam fidem cogi
jure naturae non poterit.

IV. 1 Tertius gradus est, ubi ad determinationem ta-
lem accedit signum volendi jus proprium alteri conferre:
quae perfecta promissio⁴ est, similem habens effectum qualem
alienatio dominii. Est enim aut via ad alienationem rei, aut
alienatio particulae cujusdam nostrae libertatis, Illuc pertinent
promissa dandi, huc promissa faciendi. Ejus quod dicimus
insigne nobis argumentum praebent divina oracula, quae nos
docent bDeum ipsum, qui nulla constituta lege obstringi

 

or aecessory to it, that is not intrinsic to the change, as a change,
but belongs to the 1nattcr3 sor instance, if the first intention was
the better of the two.

III. The second degree is, when the will determines itself for a
future time, with a sufficient sign to indicate the necessity of perse-
verIng [I will θῖνα you] This may be called pollicitcztz'0n; it is
obligatory without the Civil Law, either absolutely or conditionally,
but it does not give to another person a proper right *. For in many
cases it happens that there is an Obligation in us, and no corresponding
Right in another: as appears in the duties of mercy and gratitud03
and to these, the duty of constancy οι* fidelity is similar. Therefore
in virtue of such pollicitation, the thing so promised cannot be
retained, 01· he who made the promise be compelled by Natural Law
to fulfil it. .

IV. 1 Tho third degree is, when to such a determination is
added a sign of wishing to confer a proper right upon another: [I
promise you:] which is a perfect promise, with the same effects as
alienation of ownership. For it is either a way to the alienation of
the thing, or it is an alicnation of some portion of our liberty. To the
former head belong promises to give, to the latter, promises to do.

A strong example of what we say is furnished by the Scriptures,
which teach us that God himself, who cannot be compelled by any

³* It is better to use Obliqatinn only as correlative to Rin, and Duly when
there is no such correlative Right, but a moral claim. E. M. 84, 89.
