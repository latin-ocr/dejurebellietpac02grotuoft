rum alienarum in nos dominium transire sine consensu domini,

si res sint tales, quae pondere, numerO, et mensura aestimari
soleant. Nam res ejus generis functionem quidem recipere
dicuntur, id est, restitui posse per id quod genere idem est,
sed ita demum si consensus praecesserit, aut ex lege aut more
praecessisse intelligatur, ut in mutuo; aut etiam si res, utpote

consumta, exhiberi nequeat. At extra talem consensum, vel L. 15091151. 2.

reasonably introduced by seme laws. The reason is, that no one is
bound by the reason for which the thing is given, except it be a thing
belonging to another: but in the case now supposed, the ownership
passes in virtue of the will of the former owner. It is another matter
if there be something wrong in the mode of acquisition3 for instance,
extortion: for this is another principle of obligation, concerning which
we do not now speak.

XIII. Let us add also this, erroneously ruled by Medina: that
'tho ownership of things belonging to others may pass to us without
the consent of the owner, if they are such things as are commonly
valucd according to number, weight, aud measure. Things of this
kind are said functionem recipere, to be such that our portion may pass
for another, so that they may be restored by means of that which is
not identical, but only the same in kind. But this can be done only
when consent has preceded, or may, by law or usage, bc understood to
have preceded, as in lending3 or if the thing, being consumcd, cannot
be exhibited. But without such consent, express or presumed, and
without necessity, that sanction has no place.
