XXVII. Atque hinc apparet quam male Ferdinandus
Vasquius dixerit, justam causam dispensandi, id est lege sol-
vendi, esse eam tantum de qua legis auctor consultus dixisset,
extra mentem suam esse eam observari. Non distinxit enim
inter ἐπιείκειαν, quae legem interpretatur, et inter relaxatio-
nem. Unde et alibi Thomam et Sotum reprehendit, quod
dicant legem obligare etiamsi causa particulariter cesset,
quasi legem esse putassent solam scripturam, quod illis nun-
quam in mentem venit. Tantum vero abest ut omnis legis

gives testimony by word and by deed that he is indulgent in forgiv-
ing such. [See the passages] And that by those words of Christ,
Fazher, forfice them ; sor they know not what they do, Theodosius was
moved to pardon the Antiochians, is noted by John chrysostom.
XXVII. And hence it appears how ill Vasquius said, that a just
cause of dispensing with, that is of relaxing the law, was such alone
as one about which, if the author of the law had been consulted‚ he
would have said that it was not in his mind to have it observed.
Here he has not distinguished between the equity which inter-
prets the laW, and a relaxation of it. And on this ground he else-
where reproaches Thomas Aquinas and Sotus, for saying that
the law obliges, even though the cause in particular ceases, as if they
had thought that the law was only the written word, which never
carne into their minds. For so far is it from being the case that
