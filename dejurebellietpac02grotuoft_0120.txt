1Οῶ DE JUREJURANDO. [Lm. 11.

imperia possint videamus. Superiorum actus hoc quidem
efficere non potest, ut jusjurandum quatenus vere fuit obliga-
torium non sit praestandum : id enim juris est naturalis et divini.
Sed quia actus nostri non plene sunt in nostra potestate, sed
ita ut a superioribus dependeant, 2ideo duplex esse potest
actus superiorum circa id quod juratur, alter directus in per-
sonam jurantiS, alter in personam cui juratur.

2 In personam jurantis dirigi potest, aut antequam jure-
tur irritum reddendo juramentum, quatenus jus inferioris sub
potestate superioris continetur, aut postquam juratum est
vetando ne impleatur. Nam inferior, qua inferior, obstrin-
gere se non potuit nisi quatenus superiori id placiturum esset:
ampliorem enim non habebat potestatem. Hoc modo lege
Hebraea mariti uxorum, patres liberorum qui sui juris nondum
erant, juramenta irrita faciebant. Proponit hauc quaestionem
Seneca: Sa· lem lata erit, ne id quisquam faciat quod eqo
me amico meo jacturam promiseram? et solvit: Eadem
lex me defendit quse vetat. Sed et actus ex utroque mixtus
esse potest, ut si superior constituat quod inferior juraverit

do [in modifying the effect of oaths]. The act of a superior cannot
effect that au oath, so far as it was obligatory, is not to be performed3
for that it is to be 50, is a matter both of Natural and of Divine
Law. But because our acts are not fully in our power, but in such
a way that they depend on superiorS, therefore there may be a double
act of a superior as to the matter sworn; one direct, on the person of
the swearer, the other, on the person to whom the oath is made.

2 The act of the superior may be directed on the person of the
swearer, either before swearing, rendering the oath void, in so far as
the right of the inferior is subject to the superior3 or after the swear-
ing, forbidding that it be fulfilled. For the inferior, as inferior, was
not able to bind himself except so far as it should please his superior3
ho had no further power. And thus by the Hebrew Law the
husband might make void the vows of his wife. Seneca proposes
this question: If d law be made that πο one shall do what Ι had pro-
mised my friend I would do, what then? And he solves it, saying,
The Saule law which forbids me defends me. But there may be a
mixed act of both parties3 as if the superior should direct that
what the inferior shall swear in this or that ease, say from sear or
from weakness of judgment, shall be valid, only if he himself approves
