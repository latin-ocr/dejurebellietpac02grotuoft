152 DE FEDERIBL’S Ac SPONSIONIBUS. [Lm. 11.

tali modo facta efficit, ut si factum praestari nequeat, nihil
aliud sit in obligatione: succedit enim certum loco incerti
quod intere-st. Erat autem communis istorum temporum sen-
tentia, etiam vitam valide posse obligari.

mam potestatem ex notitia et silentio. Hic distinguendum
primum an pure facta sit sponsio, an sub conditione si rata
haberetur a summa potestate. Nam haec conditio non im-

thing certain into the place of an uncertain compensation. And at
that time the common opinion was, that aman’s life might be serionsly
given as a pledge.

4 But with us who think differently, Ι am of opinion that by such
a convention, first, the party's goods are liable for compensation of the
interest affected, aad if they are not sufficient, that his body is sor-
feited to slavery. V'hen Fabius Maximus had made an agreement
with the enemy. which the Senate repudiated, he sold his lauded pro-
perty for macco sesterces, and made good the loss. And the Samnites
rightly conceived that Brutulus Papius, who broke a truce, should be
given up along with his property.

XVII. 1 Another question is, whether a convention made by a
subordinate. person, on his own responsibility, biuds the supreme
power, b5 knowledge and silence on their part. Here we must first
distinguish whether the eom-entim] is made siinpl5, or under condition
of being ratified by the supreme power. For if so, this condition, not
fulfflled, (sor conditions must be expressly fulfflled) nullifies the con-
ventiong which applies to the convention of Lutatius with the Cartha-
gimnus: to which was to be added, that the people, because that con-
vention was made without its authority, denied that it was bound
thereby: and therefore another treaty was made on a fresh footing
