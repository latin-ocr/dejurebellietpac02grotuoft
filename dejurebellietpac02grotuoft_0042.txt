32 DE PROMISSIS. [ΜΒ. 11.

missum est, scd quod interest: ceterum pacta, quam ex se
non habent vim, eam accipere aut ex contractibus, quibus
insunt aut adjiciuntur, aut ex rei traditione: unde nasci par-
tim actiones, partim exceptiones, et vetitam repetitionem.

Quae vero pacta vim obligandi secundum leges habeant, ut
pacta stipulata, et alia quaedam, habere eam legum beneficio,
quarum ea est efficacia, ut quod per se honestum est, id efficere
possint etiam necessarium.

3 Verum haec sententia, ita generaliter ut ab ipso effer-
tur accepta, consistere non potest. Primum enim sequitur
inde inter reges et populos diversos, pactorum, quamdiu nihil
ex iis praestitum est, vim esse nullam, praesertim iis in locis,
ubi nulla certa forma foederum aut sponsionum reperta est.
Tum vero ratio nulla reperiri potest, cur legeS, quae quasi pac-
tum commune sunt populi, atque hoc nomine vocantur ab
Aristotele et Demosthene, obligationem pactis possint addere3
voluntas autem cujusque, hoc omni modo agentis ut se obliget,
idem non possit, praecipue ubi lex civilis impedimentum non
affert. Adde quod, voluntate sufficienter significata, trans-
ferri rei dominium potest, ut ante diximus: quid ni ergo

having been taken, he pronounces that what you ought to do, is not
what is promised, but what is for the interest of the promiseet—-that the
pacts, not having any force of themselves, receive force from the con-
tracts of which they are parts or additions, οι· from the delivery of the
thing in question3 whence arise, partly actions, partly exceptions to
actions, and prohibitions of suit.

But pacts which have an obligatory force according to the Laws,
as pacts with stipulations and some others, have, he holds, this force
by the help of the laws, which have this efficacy, that what of itself is
proper, they make to be necessary.

3 But this opinion cannot stand, in the general form in which he
propounds it. For, in the first place, it follows therefrom that pacts
between kings and different peoples, so long as nothing thereof is per-
formed (νε iliteyrd) have no force3 [the parties being bound by no
common instituted law 3] especially in those places in which no regular
form of treaties and engagements has been introduced.

And again, no reason can be found why laws, which are in a cer-
tain way a common pact of the people, and are so called by Aristotle
and Demosthenes, should be able to give obligatory force to pacts3
while the will of a person, directed especially, and by every means, to
put himself under an obligation, should not be able to do so3 especially
when the civil Law offers no impediment.
