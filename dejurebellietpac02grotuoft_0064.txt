52 DE Pacissssis [Lm. 11.

modum tertii adjectum promissioni revocari poterit, quamdiu
a tertio acceptatum non erit: quanquam non desunt tam in
hac quam in aliis quaestionibus qui secus sentiant. Sed recte
rem inspicienti facile elucet naturalis aequitas, ut multis pro-
bationibus non egeat.

XX. Solet et illud disputari, quomodo convalescere pos-
sit promissio cui error causam dedit, si re cognita promissor
stare velit promisso. Atque idem quaeri potest de promis-
sionibus, quibus lex civilis impedimentum injicit ex metu aut
causa alia, si ista causa postea cessaverit. Nam ad haec fir-
manda quidam solum actum internum requirunt, quem con-
junctum cum priore actu externo sufficere putant ad parien-
dam obligationem. Alii, quibus id displicet, ideo quia actus
externus non potest signum esse actus interni sequentis, re-
quirunt novam verbis factam promissionem et acceptationem.
Verior est media sententia, actum quidem externum requiri,
sed non utique verbis factum, cum retentio rei promissae ex
parte ejus cui promissa est, et relictio ejus ex parte pro·
mittentis, aut simile aliquid, sufficere possint ad significandum
consensum.

XXI. Hoc quoque omittendum non est, ne jura civilia

long as it is not accepted by that third party: although there are
not wanting, in this as in other questions, those who think otherwise.
But to a person who looks rightly at the matter the natural equity
will appear evident, so that it will not need many proofs.

XX. This also is often disputed, how a promise founded in
error can recover its force, if the promiser wishes to stand by his
pronfise. And the same question may be asked concerning pro-
mises, which are void by the Civil Law on account of sear or other
causes, if the cause afterwards have ceased. For to confirm these,
they require only an internal act, which, conjoined with the former
external act, they think suffices to produce an obligation. Others,
not satisfied with this, because an external act cannot be a sign of
a subsequenti internal act, require a new promise expressed and ac-
cepted. The middle opinion is the true one: that an external act
is required, but not expressed in words, when the retention of the
thing promised by the promisee, and its relinquishment on the part
of the promiser, or any similar event, may suffice to signify consent.

XXI. This also is not to be omitted, in order that Civil Law
and Natural Law may not be confounded3 that promises which have
no cause expressed, are not void by Natural Law, any more than
donations of property.
