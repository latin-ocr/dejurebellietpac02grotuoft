XIV. Contractibus vero eorum, qui sine jure imperium
invaserunt, non tenebuntur populi aut veri reges3 nam hi jus
obligandi populum non habuerunt. De in rem verso tamen
tenebuntur, id est quatenus locupletiores faeti sunt.

 

XIV. By contracts made by thoso who without right have usurped
the government‚ the People, 01· the Legitimato Sovereign are not
bound. For Usurpers have no authority to bind the People. How-
ever, the People aro bound by what has been expended for their
benefit [by an usurpet 3] that is, so far as they are the richer for it.
