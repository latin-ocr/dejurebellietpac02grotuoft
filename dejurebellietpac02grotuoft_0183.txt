cim. XVI] DE INTERPRETATIONE. 167

adscitos defendere non licuit? Imo vero licuit, non ex vi
federis, sed ex jure naturali, quod federe non erat abdicatum:
ita ut Saguntini apud utrosque eo essent loco, quasi nihil de
sociis convenisset: quo casu nec Carthaginienses eontra fedus
erant facturi, si in Saguntinos arma moverent quae justa
arbitrarentur, nec Romani si eos defenderent. Plane sicut
Pyrrhi tempore inter Carthaginienses et Romanos conve-
nerat, ut si eorum populorum alter cum Pyrrho fedus faceret, {3¹3} Hist-
ita faceret ut jus auxilia mittendi ei, quem Pyrrhus bello
impeteret, salvum maneret. Non dico justum utrinque bellum
esse potuisse3 sed nnego pertinuisse 1100 ad federis viola-
tionem: quomodo in quaestione de auxilio Mamertinis misso
a Romanis distinguit Polybius, an justum id fuerit, et an per Lib-iit‘ffi-
fedus licuerit.

3 Et hoc ipsum est, quod Corcyrenses apud Thucydidem
dicunt Atheniensibus, licere ipsis sibi auxilia mittere, neem-1³⁵-
obstare quod Athenienses habebant cum Lacedaemoniis fedus,

into alliance, or when aIIIed, to defend them? Certainly this was
lawful, notin virtue of the league, but in virtue of Natural Law,
which they had not abdieated by the treaty: so that the Saguntinos
should be in the same situation as if no convention had been mado
about allies: in which case the Carthaginians would not be aeting
against the league, if they made what they conceived to be a just war
against the Saguntines3 nor the Romans, if they defended them: just
as at the time of Pyrrhus, an agreement was made between the Car-
thaginians and Romans, that if either of those Peoples made a leaguo
with Pyrrhus, it should be lawful for the other 10 do so likewise. Ι
(10 1101 say the war could have been just on both sides; but Ι deny
that this point had to do with the violation of the league: as in the
question concerning the Mamertinos, Polybius distinguishes the points,
whether it was just, and whether it was consistent with the league.

3 And this is exactly what the Corcyreans in Thucydides say to the
Atheniens, that it is lawful for them to send aid to them, and that it
is not- an objection‚ that the Atheniens had a league with the Lacedae-
monians, since by that league it was lawful to acquire new allies.
