CAr. XV.] DE FEDERIBUS Ac SPONSIONIBUS. 131

contractus inest, natura obligationem multo strictiorem desi-
derat. N am qui contrahendo aliquid de suo dat, aut promittit,
is vicissim praestari reipsa sibi aliquid vult3 unde et jure civili,
quod facti alieni promissiones repudiat, promissio tamen ratam
rem haberi ad id quod interest obstringit.

IV. Federa Menippus regis Antiochi ad Romanos Lega-
tus, referente dLivio, magis ex usu suo quam ex praescripto gib. xxxiv
artis ita divisit, ut diceret& tria esse eorum federum, quae inter
se paciscerentur reges civitatesque, genera: unum cum bello
victis dicerentur leges, quo in genere quid victum habere,
quo mulctari eum vellet, victoris esse arbitrium: alterum, cum
pares bello aequo federe in pacem atque amicitiam venirent:
tunc repeti reddique per conventionem res, et si quarum tur-
bata bello possessio sit, eas aut ex formula juris antiqui, aut ex
partis utriusque commodo componi: tertium esse genus, cum
qui hostes nunquam fuerint ad amicitiam sociali federe inter
se jungendam coeant: quos nec dicere leges, nec accipere.

made a convention respecting something which belongs to the rights
of the pcople, let us sce to what they arc bound. It may be thought
perhaps that, in this case, the party who made the convention have
performed their engagement, if they have done all that was possible for
them, that the terms of the convention on their part should bc ful-
filled3 according to what we have said in speaking of promises.
But the nature of these affairs, which involve a contract and not a
mere promise, requires a much stricter obligation. For he who in a
contract gives anything of his own, 01· promises it, expects some-
thing to be donc for him by the other side: whence by the Civil Law
also, which repudiates promises for the acts of others, yet a promise
of the agent binds and is valid so far as he is concerned.

IV. In Livy, Menippus, rather for his purpose than scientifically,
divides Treaties between Kings and States into three kinds3 treaties
of a conqueror in war with the eonquered, and in these the tcrms
depend on the will of the victor: treaties of peace between parties
who end a war with equal suecess3 and here the terms are equal,
and possessions which had been disturbed by war are restored by
agreement3 and these treaties are constructcd either on the ancient
forms, or according to the convenience of the parties: and the third
kind, when those who have never been cnemics make a treaty of
