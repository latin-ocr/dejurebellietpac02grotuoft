31⁴8 DE POENARUM COMMUNICATIONE. [LIB. ΙΙ.

Fabios sibi dedi Galli postulabant, quod in se pugnassent. Ab
Hernicis agri sui populatores dedi sibi postularunt Romani3
et a Poenis Amilcarcm, non illum nobilem ducem, scd alium
qui Gallos concitabat: rpostularunt et postea Annibalem: item
J ugurtham a Boccho his apud Sallustium verbis: simul nobis
demeres acerbam necessitudinem pariter te errantem et illum
seeleracissz'mzmt persequi. Ab ipsis Romanis dediti qui Car-
thaginiensium, quiquo Apolloniatarum legatis manus intulerant.
Achaei a Lacedaemoniis dedi sibi postularunt eos, qui Lan.
vicum oppugnassent, addito, ni dederentur violatum videri

Philippo insidias struxisset, et Athenas confugisset, παραδόσι-

tensibus exegerunt, ut qui Phocum interfecerant, dederentur.
3 Quae omnia tamen sic intelligenda sunt, ut non stricte
populus aut rex ad dedendum teneatur, sed ut diximus ad
dedendum aut puniendum. Nam ita legimus Eleos bellum

and, at another time, because those were not given up who had done
violence to virgins sent to perform a sacred office. So Cato advised
that Cesar should be given up to the Germans, for wrongfully making
war upon them. So the Gauls demanded that the Fabii should bo
given up to them, because they had fought against them. The Romans
required thosc who had plundered their land to be given up to them
by the Hernici 3 and Amilcar, by the Carthaginians, not the celebrated
general, but another, who stimulated the Gauls: they afterwards de-
manded Annibal3 and Jugurtha from Bocchus, that, as Sallust- puts it,
gaon may relieve us from the pctiigfzcl necessity of pzcnz'shz'ny at the same
time, you. who are in error, and him who is most criminal. The Romans
themselves gave up those who had done violence to the ambassadors of
the Carthaginians; and again, of the Apolloniates. The Achaeans re-
quired the Laccdoemonians to give up those who had attacked the
town of Las, adding, that if they did not do so, the league was vio-
latcd.v So the Athenians proclaimed by a herald, that if any one
practised secretly against Philip, and then fled to Athens, he would
be liable to be given up. The Beotians required of the Hippotians
that those who had siaiu Phocus should be given up.
