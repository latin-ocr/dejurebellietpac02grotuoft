nes classibus eam navem se oppressuros minarentur, nisi me
unum sibi dedidissent: si id vectores nequirent, ac mecum
simul interire, quam me hostibus tradere mallent: jecissem
me potius ipse in profundum; ut ceteros conservarem,
quam illos mei tam cupidos non modo ad certam mortem,
sed in massnuin vitce discrimen adducerem. Idem de Finibus
111: Vir bonus et sapiens, et Zeyibus parens, et civilis
officii non iynarus, utilitati omnium plus quam unius ali-
cujus aut suae consulit. Apud Livium de Molossis quibusdam
dictum legimus: equidem pro patria, qui Zethum oppetissent‚
soepe fando audivi: qui patriam pro se perire oequum cen-
serent, hi primi inventi sunt.

tenetur, ad hoc cogi quoque possit. Negat hoc Sotus exem-
plo divitis qui egeno stipem dare ex misericordiae praescripto
tenetur, cogi tamen nequit. Sed notandum est, aliam esse
rationem partium inter se, aliam superiorum, ubi cum sibi sub-

submit to death, after the example of the daughters of Leos and the
Hyacinthids, than bring an irreparable calamity on their country.
Cicero, pleading for Sextius, says, that if he were in a ship attacked
by pirates who demanded him in particular, and would destroy the
ship if he were not given up, he would rather throw himself into
the sea than bring upon all the rest, not only certain death, but even
extreme danger of death. And again, he says that a wise and good
man will rather consult the safety of all than of any one in parti-

cular, even of himself. In Livy we read: I have often heard of “

men who would die for their country, but I never heard of any who
thought it reasonable that their country should perish for them.

4 But, this being assumed, there remains this doubt, whether,
what they are thus bound to do, they can be compelled to do. Sotus
denies this, adducing the example of a rich man who is bound to give
alms to a needy man by the rule of mel-cy, but cannot be compelled
to do so. But it is to be remarked that the relation of such parties
is different from that of superiors compared with subjects. For an
equal cannot compel an equal, except to that which he has a right to,
speaking strictly. But a superior can compel him to other things also
which any virtue prescribes; because in the peculiar right of a supe-
rior as superior, this is comprehended. Thus in a great scarcity of
